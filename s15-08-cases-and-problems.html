        <p class="para" id="collins-ch11_s08_p01">How’d you like to own a Series 3 BMW? How about a convertible priced at $48,000 for those warm summer days? Or maybe a less expensive coupe for $39,000? Or, if you need more space for hauling camping equipment, dogs, or kids, maybe you would prefer a wagon at $37,000? We can’t help you finance a BMW, but we can show you how they’re made. Go to <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bmw-plant-munich.com/">http://www.bmw-plant-munich.com/</a> to link to the BMW Web site for a virtual tour of the company’s Munich, Germany, plant.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch11_s08_p02">First, click on “Location” and then on “The Plant in Figures.” Before going any further, answer the following questions:</p>

            <li>How many cars are made in the plant each day? How many engines?</li>

        <h3 class="title">Career Opportunities</h3>
        <p class="simpara"><strong class="emphasis bold">Wanted: Problem Solvers and Creative Thinkers</strong></p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch11_s08_p04">If you had a time machine plus a craving for a great hamburger, you could return to the early 1950s and swing by Dick and Mac McDonald’s burger stand in San Bernardino, California. Take a break from eating and watch the people in the kitchen. You’ll see an early application of operations management in the burger industry. Dick and Mac, in an effort to sell more burgers in less time, redesigned their kitchen to use assembly-line procedures. As the number of happy customers grew, word spread about their speedy system, and their business thrived. Curiously, it wasn’t Dick and Mac who made McDonald’s what it is today, but rather a traveling milkshake-mixer salesman named Ray Kroc. He visited the hamburger stand to learn how they could sell twenty thousand shakes a year. When he saw their operations and the lines of people walking away with bags filled with burgers, fries, and shakes, he knew he had a winner. In cooperation with the McDonald brothers, he started selling franchises around the country, and the rest is history.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch11_s08_p05">So, what does this story have to do with a career in operations management? If you’re a problem solver like Dick and Mac (who discovered a way to make burgers faster and cheaper) or a creative thinker like Ray Kroc (who recognized the value in an assembly-line burger production system), then a career in operations management might be for you. The field is broad and offers a variety of opportunities. To get a flavor of the choices available, go to <a class="link" href="http://www.wetfeet.com/Careers-and-Industries/Careers/Operations.aspx">http://www.wetfeet.com/Careers-and-Industries/Careers/Operations.aspx</a> to link to the WetFeet Web site and review the dozen or so operations management positions listed. Provide a brief description of each position. Indicate how interesting you find each position by rating it using a five-point scale (with 1 being uninteresting and 5 being very interesting). Based on your assessment, pick the position you find most interesting and the one you find least interesting. Explain why you made your selections.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Ethics Angle (AACSB)</h3>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch11_s08_p06">In many ways, Eastman Kodak (a multinational manufacturer and distributor of photographic equipment and supplies) is a model corporate citizen. <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> magazine has ranked it as one of the country’s most admired companies, applauding it in particular for its treatment of minorities and women. Its community-affairs programs and contributions have also received praise, but Eastman Kodak remains weak in one important aspect of corporate responsibility: it has consistently received low scores on environmental practices. For example, the watchdog group Scorecard rated Eastman Kodak’s Rochester, New York, facility as the third-worst emitter of airborne carcinogens in the United States. Other reports have criticized the company for dumping cancer-causing chemicals into the nation’s waters.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch11_s08_p07">Go to <a class="link" href="http://www.kodak.com/US/en/corp/HSE/homepage.jhtml?pd-path=2879/7196">http://www.kodak.com/US/en/corp/HSE/homepage.jhtml?pd-path=2879/7196</a> to link to the Eastman Kodak Web site and read its own assessment of its environmental practices. Then answer the following questions:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="collins-ch11_s08_l03">
            <li>Based on the information provided on its Web site, how favorable do you feel about Eastman Kodak’s environmental practices?</li>
            <li>In what ways is the company responding to criticisms of its environmental practices and improving them?</li>
            <li>Do the statements on the Web site mesh with the criticism that the company has received? If not, what accounts for the differences?</li>

                </p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch11_s08_p08">Instead of going to the store to try on several pairs of jeans that may or may not fit, wouldn’t it be easier to go online and order a pair of perfect-fitting jeans? Lands’ End has made this kind of shopping possible through mass-customization techniques and some sophisticated technology.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch11_s08_p09">To gain some firsthand experience at shopping for mass-customized goods, have each member of your team go to Nike’s iD site at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://nikeid.nike.com">http://nikeid.nike.com</a>. Each team member should go through the process of customizing a different Nike product but stop right before placing an order. After everyone has gone through the process, get together and write a report in which the team explains exactly what’s entailed by online mass customization and details the process at Nike. Be sure to say which things impressed you and which didn’t. Explain why Nike developed this means of marketing products and, finally, offer some suggestions on how the process could be improved.</p>

        <h3 class="title">The Global View (AACSB)</h3>
        <p class="simpara"><strong class="emphasis bold">What’s the State of Homeland Job Security?</strong></p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch11_s08_p10">Over the past several decades, more and more U.S. manufacturers began outsourcing production to such low-wage countries as Mexico and China. The number of U.S. manufacturing jobs dwindled, and the United States became more of a service economy. People who were directly affected were understandably unhappy about this turn of events, but most people in this country didn’t feel threatened. At least, not until service jobs also started going to countries that, like India, have large populations of well-educated, English-speaking professionals. Today, more technology-oriented jobs, including those in programming and Internet communications, are being outsourced to countries with lower wage rates. And tech workers aren’t alone: the jobs of accountants, analysts, bankers, medical technicians, paralegals, insurance adjusters, and even customer-service representatives have become candidates for overseas outsourcing.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch11_s08_p11">Many U.S. workers are concerned about job security (though the likelihood of a particular individual’s losing a job to an overseas worker is still fairly low). The issues are more complex than merely deciding where U.S. employers should be mailing paychecks, and politicians, economists, business executives, and the general public differ about the causes and consequences of foreign outsourcing. Some people think it’s a threat to American quality of life, while others actually think that it’s a good thing.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch11_s08_p12">Spend some time researching trends in outsourcing. Formulate some opinions, and then answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch11_s08_l04">
            <li>About what percentage of U.S. jobs have left the country in the last five years? What percentage will probably leave in the next five years?</li>
            <li>What kinds of jobs are being outsourced, and where are they going? What kinds of jobs can’t be outsourced?</li>
            <li>How does global outsourcing help U.S. businesses? How does it hinder them?</li>
            <li>How has the trend in outsourcing manufacturing and service operations to foreign countries helped average Americans? How has it harmed them?</li>
            <li>Does overseas outsourcing help or hurt the U.S. economy? In what ways?</li>
