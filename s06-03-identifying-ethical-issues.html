        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_p01">Make no mistake about it: When you enter the business world, you’ll find yourself in situations in which you’ll have to choose the appropriate behavior. How, for example, would you answer questions like the following?</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_l02">
        <li>Is it OK to accept a pair of sports tickets from a supplier?</li>
        <li>Can I buy office supplies from my brother-in-law?</li>
        <li>Is it appropriate to donate company funds to my local community center?</li>
        <li>If I find out that a friend is about to be fired, can I warn her?</li>
        <li>Will I have to lie about the quality of the goods I’m selling?</li>
        <li>Can I take personal e-mails and phone calls at work?</li>
        <li>What do I do if I discover that a coworker is committing fraud?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_p02">Obviously, the types of situations are numerous and varied. Fortunately, we can break them down into a few basic categories: <em class="emphasis">bribes</em>, <em class="emphasis">conflicts of interest</em>, <em class="emphasis">conflicts of loyalty</em>, <em class="emphasis">issues of honesty and integrity</em>, and <em class="emphasis">whistle-blowing</em>. Let’s look a little more closely at each of these categories.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch02_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Bribes versus Gifts</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s01_p01">It’s not uncommon in business to give and receive small gifts of appreciation. But when is a gift unacceptable? When is it really a bribe? If it’s OK to give a bottle of wine to a corporate client during the holidays, is it OK to give a case of wine? If your company is trying to get a big contract, is it appropriate to send a gift to the key decision maker? If it’s all right to invite a business acquaintance to dinner or to a ball game, is it also all right to offer the same person a fully paid weekend getaway?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s01_p02">There’s often a fine line between a gift and a bribe. The questions that we’ve just asked, however, may help in drawing it, because they raise key issues in determining how a gesture should be interpreted: the cost of the item, the timing of the gift, the type of gift, and the connection between the giver and the receiver. If you’re on the receiving end, it’s a good idea to refuse any item that’s overly generous or given for the purpose of influencing a decision. But because accepting even small gifts may violate company rules, the best advice is to check on company policy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s01_p03">JCPenney’s “Statement of Business Ethics,” for instance, states that employees can’t accept any cash gifts or any noncash gifts except those that have a value below $50 and that are generally used by the giver for promotional purposes. Employees can attend paid-for business functions, but other forms of entertainment, such as sports events and golf outings, can be accepted only if it’s practical for the Penney’s employee to reciprocate. Trips of several days can’t be accepted under any circumstances.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_021">JCPenney Co., “Statement of Business Ethics for Associates and Officers: The ‘Spirit’ of This Statement,” <a class="link" href="http://ir.jcpenney.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=70528&amp;p=irol-govconduct">http://ir.jcpenney.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=70528&amp;p=irol-govconduct</a> (accessed April 24, 2006).</span></p>

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch02_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Conflicts of Interest</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Conflicts of interest</a><span class="glossdef">Situation in which an individual must choose between the promotion of personal interests and the interests of others.</span></span> occur when individuals must choose between taking actions that promote their personal interests over the interests of others or taking actions that don’t. A conflict can exist, for example, when an employee’s own interests interfere with, or have the potential to interfere with, the best interests of the company’s stakeholders (management, customers, owners). Let’s say that you work for a company with a contract to cater events at your college and that your uncle owns a local bakery. Obviously, this situation could create a conflict of interest (or at least give the appearance of one—which, by the way, is a problem in itself). When you’re called on to furnish desserts for a luncheon, you might be tempted to throw some business your uncle’s way even if it’s not in the best interest of the catering company that you work for.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s02_p02">What should you do? You should probably disclose the connection to your boss, who can then arrange things so that your personal interests don’t conflict with the company’s. You may, for example, agree that if you’re assigned to order products like those that your uncle makes, you’re obligated to find another supplier. Or your boss may make sure that someone else orders bakery products.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s02_p03">The same principle holds that an employee shouldn’t use private information about an employer for personal financial benefit. Say that you learn from a coworker at your pharmaceutical company that one of its most profitable drugs will be pulled off the market because of dangerous side effects. The recall will severely hurt the company’s financial performance and cause its stock price to plummet. Before the news becomes public, you sell all the stock you own in the company. What you’ve done isn’t merely unethical: It’s called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">insider trading</a><span class="glossdef">Practice of buying or selling of securities using important information about the company before it’s made public.</span></span>, it’s illegal, and you could go to jail for it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch02_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Conflicts of Loyalty</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s03_p01">Sometimes you find yourself in a bind between being loyal either to your employer or to a friend or family member. Perhaps you just learned that a coworker, a friend of yours, is about to be downsized out of his job. You also happen to know that he and his wife are getting ready to make a deposit on a house near the company headquarters. From a work standpoint, you know that you shouldn’t divulge the information. From a friendship standpoint, though, you feel it’s your duty to tell your friend. Wouldn’t he tell you if the situation were reversed? So what do you do? As tempting as it is to be loyal to your friend, you shouldn’t. As an employee, your primary responsibility is to your employer. You might be able to soften your dilemma by convincing a manager with the appropriate authority to tell your friend the bad news before he puts down his deposit.</p>

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Issues of Honesty and Integrity</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04_p01">Master investor Warren Buffet once told a group of business students the following:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04_p02">“I cannot tell you that honesty is the best policy. I can’t tell you that if you behave with perfect honesty and integrity somebody somewhere won’t behave the other way and make more money. But honesty is a good policy. You’ll do fine, you’ll sleep well at night and you’ll feel good about the example you are setting for your coworkers and the other people who care about you.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_022">Quoted by Adrian Gostick and Dana Telford, <em class="emphasis">The Integrity Advantage</em> (Salt Lake City: Gibbs Smith, 2003), 103.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04_p03">If you work for a company that settles for its employees’ merely obeying the law and following a few internal regulations, you might think about moving on. If you’re being asked to deceive customers about the quality or value of your product, you’re in an ethically unhealthy environment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04_p04">Think about this story:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04_bl02">
            <p class="para editable" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04_p05">“A chef put two frogs in a pot of warm soup water. The first frog smelled the onions, recognized the danger, and immediately jumped out. The second frog hesitated: The water felt good, and he decided to stay and relax for a minute. After all, he could always jump out when things got too hot (so to speak). As the water got hotter, however, the frog adapted to it, hardly noticing the change. Before long, of course, he was the main ingredient in frog-leg soup.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_023">Adapted from Adrian Gostick and Dana Telford, <em class="emphasis">The Integrity Advantage</em> (Salt Lake City: Gibbs Smith, 2003), 16.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04_p06">So, what’s the moral of the story? Don’t sit around in an ethically toxic environment and lose your integrity a little at a time; get out before the water gets too hot and your options have evaporated.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04_p07">Fortunately, a few rules of thumb can guide you. We’ve summed them up in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch02_s03_s04_f01">Figure 2.4 "How to Maintain Honesty and Integrity"</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Whistle-Blowing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s05_p01">As we’ve seen, the misdeeds of Betty Vinson and her accomplices at WorldCom didn’t go undetected. They caught the eye of Cynthia Cooper, the company’s director of internal auditing. Cooper, of course, could have looked the other way, but instead she summoned up the courage to be a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">whistle-blower</a><span class="glossdef">Individual who exposes illegal or unethical behavior in an organization.</span></span>—an individual who exposes illegal or unethical behavior in an organization. Like Vinson, Cooper had majored in accounting at Mississippi State and was a hard-working, dedicated employee. Unlike Vinson, however, she refused to be bullied by her boss, CFO Scott Sullivan. In fact, she had tried to tell not only Sullivan but also auditors from the huge Arthur Andersen accounting firm that there was a problem with WorldCom’s books. The auditors dismissed her warnings, and when Sullivan angrily told her to drop the matter, she started cleaning out her office. But she didn’t relent. She and her team worked late each night, conducting an extensive, secret investigation. Two months later, Cooper had evidence to take to Sullivan, who told her once again to back off. Again, however, she stood up to him, and though she regretted the consequences for her WorldCom coworkers, she reported the scheme to the company’s board of directors. Within days, Sullivan was fired and the largest accounting fraud in history became public.</p>
        <div class="figure medium editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s05_f01">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 2.5</span> Cynthia Cooper</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s05_p02">As a result of Cooper’s actions, executives came clean about the company’s financial situation. The conspiracy of fraud was brought to an end, and though public disclosure of WorldCom’s problems resulted in massive stock-price declines and employee layoffs, investor and employee losses would have been greater without Cooper’s intervention.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s05_p03">Even though Cooper did the right thing, the experience wasn’t exactly gratifying. A lot of people applauded her action, but many coworkers shunned her; some even blamed <em class="emphasis">her</em> for the company’s troubles. She’s never been thanked by any senior executive at WorldCom. Five months after the fraud went public, new CEO Michael Capellas assembled what was left of the demoralized workforce to give them a pep talk on the company’s future. The senior management team mounted the stage and led the audience in a rousing rendition of “If you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands!” Cynthia Cooper wasn’t invited.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_024">See Adrian Gostick and Dana Telford, <em class="emphasis">The Integrity Advantage</em> (Salt Lake City: Gibbs Smith, 2003), 13.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s05_p04">Whistle-blowing often means career suicide. A survey of two hundred whistle-blowers conducted by the National Whistleblower Center found that half of them had been fired for blowing the whistle.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_025">National Whistleblower Center, “Labor Day Report: The National Status of Whistleblower Protection on Labor Day, 2002,” <a class="link" href="http://www.whistleblowers.org/labordayreport.htm">http://www.whistleblowers.org/labordayreport.htm</a> (accessed April 24, 2006).</span> Even those who get to keep their jobs experience painful repercussions. As long as they stay, some people will treat them (as one whistle-blower puts it) “like skunks at a picnic”; if they leave, they’re frequently blackballed in the industry.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_026">Paula Dwyer et al., “Year of the Whistleblower,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek Online</em>, December 16, 2002, <a class="link" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_50/b3812094.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_50/b3812094.htm</a> (accessed January 22, 2012).</span> On a positive note, there’s the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which protects whistle-blowers under federal law.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s05_p05">For her own part, Cynthia Cooper doesn’t regret what she did. As she told a group of students at Mississippi State: “Strive to be persons of honor and integrity. Do not allow yourself to be pressured. Do what you know is right even if there may be a price to be paid.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_027">Scott Waller, “Whistleblower Tells Students to Have Personal Integrity,” <em class="emphasis">The (Jackson, MS) Clarion-Ledger</em>, November 18, 2003, <a class="link" href="http://www.clarionledger.com/news/0311/18/b01.html">http://www.clarionledger.com/news/0311/18/b01.html</a> (accessed April 24, 2006).</span> If your company tells employees to do whatever it takes, push the envelope, look the other way, and “be sure that we make our numbers,” you have three choices: go along with the policy, try to change things, or leave. If your personal integrity is part of the equation, you’re probably down to the last two choices.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_028">Adrian Gostick and Dana Telford, <em class="emphasis">The Integrity Advantage</em> (Salt Lake City: Gibbs Smith, 2003), 98–99.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Refusing to Rationalize</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s06_p01">Despite all the good arguments in favor of doing the right thing, why do many reasonable people act unethically (at least at times)? Why do good people make bad choices? According to one study, there are four common rationalizations for justifying misconduct:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_029">Saul W. Gellerman, “Why ‘Good’ Managers Make Bad Ethical Choices,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review on Corporate Ethics</em> (Boston: Harvard Business School Press, 2003), 59.</span></p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s06_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">My behavior isn’t really illegal or immoral</em>. Rationalizers try to convince themselves that an action is OK if it isn’t downright illegal or blatantly immoral. They tend to operate in a gray area where there’s no clear evidence that the action is wrong.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">My action is in everyone’s best interests</em>. Some rationalizers tell themselves: “I know I lied to make the deal, but it’ll bring in a lot of business and pay a lot of bills.” They convince themselves that they’re expected to act in a certain way, forgetting the classic parental parable about jumping off a cliff just because your friends are.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_030">Adrian Gostick and Dana Telford, <em class="emphasis">The Integrity Advantage</em> (Salt Lake City: Gibbs Smith, 2003), 12.</span>
</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">No one will find out what I’ve done</em>. Here, the self-questioning comes down to “If I didn’t get caught, did I really do it?” The answer is yes. There’s a simple way to avoid succumbing to this rationalization: Always act as if you’re being watched.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">The company will condone my action and protect me</em>. This justification rests on a fallacy. Betty Vinson may honestly have believed that her actions were for the good of the company and that her boss would, therefore, accept full responsibility (as he promised). When she goes to jail, however, she’ll go on her own.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s06_p02">Here’s another rule of thumb: If you find yourself having to rationalize a decision, it’s probably a bad one. Over time, you’ll develop and hone your ethical decision-making skills.</p>
