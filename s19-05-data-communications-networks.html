Originally developed for the U.S. military and later adapted for use in academic and government research, the Internet experienced rapid growth in the 1990s, when companies called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Internet service providers</a><span class="glossdef">Company, such as America Online, that links into the Internet infrastructure to connect paying subscribers.</span></span> were allowed to link into the Internet infrastructure in order to connect paying subscribers. Today, Internet service providers, such as CompuServe, America Online (AOL), MSN, and Comcast, enable us to use the Internet to communicate with others through e-mail, texting, instant messaging, online conferencing, and so on. These services also connect us with third-party providers of information, including news stories, stock quotes, and magazine articles.</p>

The Web is a subsystem of computers that can be accessed on the Internet using a special protocol, or language, known as <em class="emphasis">hypertext transfer protocol</em> (HTTP). What’s the difference between the Internet and the Web? According to Tim Berners-Lee (one of the small team of scientists who developed the concept for the Web in 1989), the Internet is a network of networks composed of cables and computers. You can use it to send “packets” of information from one computer to another, much like sending a postcard. If the address on the packet is accurate, it will arrive at the correct destination in much less than a second. Thus, the Internet is a packet-delivery <em class="emphasis">service</em> that delivers such items as e-mail messages all over the globe. The Web, by contrast, is composed of <em class="emphasis">information</em>—documents, pictures, sounds, streaming videos, and so on. It’s connected not through cables, but rather through <em class="emphasis">hypertext links</em> that allow users to navigate between resources on the Internet.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_017">Richard T. Griffiths, “Chapter Two: The World Wide Web (WWW),” <em class="emphasis">The History of the Internet</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/history/ivh/chap2.htm">http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/history/ivh/chap2.htm</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s05_s01_p03">Because it’s driven by programs that communicate between computers connected to the Internet, the Web couldn’t exist without the Internet. The Internet, on the other hand, could exist without the Web, but it wouldn’t be nearly as useful. The Internet itself is enormous, but it’s difficult to navigate, and it has no pictures, sounds, or streamed videos. They exist on computers connected to the Web, which also makes it much easier to retrieve information. The creation of Web <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">browsers</a><span class="glossdef">Software (such as Internet Explorer) that locates and displays Web pages.</span></span>—software, such as Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, that locates and displays Web pages—opened up the Internet to a vast range of users.

Each site is maintained by a <em class="emphasis">Webmaster</em> and opens with a <em class="emphasis">home page</em>. Each Web page is accessed through a unique address called a <em class="emphasis">uniform resource locator (URL)</em>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s05_s02_p01">What’s the difference among the Internet, an intranet, and an extranet? It depends on who can and can’t access the information on the network. The Internet is a public network that anyone can use.

Say, for example, you’ve posted the following information on your intranet: company policies, payroll and benefit information, training programs, parts specifications and inventories, and production schedules. To allow suppliers to bid on contracts, you might give them access to sections of the site disclosing parts specifications, inventories, and production schedules. All other sections would be off limits. You’d control access to employee-only and supplier-accessible sections by means of usernames and passwords. As you can see from <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch15_s05_s02_f01">Figure 15.9 "How an Extranet Works"</a>, which illustrates some of the connections made possible by an extranet, access can be made available to customers and business partners, as well.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s05_s03_s02_p01">Imagine a company that retails products for schoolteachers over the Internet—for example, books, software, and teaching supplies purchased from various manufacturers and distributors. It would need facilities to store inventories and personnel to handle inventories and fill customer orders. But what if this company decided to get out of the traditional retail business? What if it decided instead to team up with three trading partners—a book publisher, a software developer, and a manufacturer of office supplies? Our original company could re-create itself as a Web site for marketing the books, software, and supplies provided by its partners, without taking physical possession of them. It would become a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">virtual company</a><span class="glossdef">Company without a significant physical presence that relies on third parties to produce, warehouse, price, and deliver the products it sells over the Internet.</span></span>.

Meanwhile, the virtual company, besides promoting all three lines of products, would verify customer orders and forward them to its partners, who would ship their own products directly to customers.
