        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s00_p01">If you enjoy gambling and want to be pampered, the Las Vegas Strip is the place for you.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_036">In November 2010, Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. changed its name to Caesars Entertainment Corporation. The Harrah’s name will still be one of the newly named company’s primary brands, in addition to Caesars and Horseshoe.</span> The four-mile stretch is home to some of the world’s most lavish hotels and casinos, each competing for its share of the thirty-seven million visitors who pack the city each year.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111128-113223-230618">Kyle Hansen, “Las Vegas Records 2.7 Percent Increase in Visitors for 2010,” <em class="emphasis">Las Vegas Sun</em>, February 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/feb/08/las-vegas-records-27-percent-increase-visitors-201/">http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/feb/08/las-vegas-records-27-percent-increase-visitors-201/</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span> The Strip is a smorgasbord of attractions. At the luxurious Mirage, you can witness the eruption of a seventy-foot volcano every quarter hour. The five-star Bellagio resort boasts a $300 million art collection (including Picassos and Van Goghs). There are star-studded shows, upscale retailers, and posh restaurants with award-winning chefs. You can relax at pools and spas or try your luck in the casinos.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s00_p02">So how does a gaming and entertainment company compete in this environment? If you’ve ever been to Las Vegas, you know that a lot of them erect mammoth, neon-bathed, brick-and-mortar casino-resorts. A few, however, do what Caesars did in the late 1990s: they invest heavily in technology and compete through the effective use of information. What kind of information? Marketers at Caesars collect information about the casino’s customers and then use it to entice the same people to return. Does the strategy work? Caesars is the world’s largest casino entertainment company in the world.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_037">Caesars, “Company Information,” Caesars, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.caesars.com/corporate/">http://www.caesars.com/corporate/</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s00_p03">Throughout this chapter, we’ll discuss the information needs of Caesars’s top executives, managers, and other employees. We’ll examine the ways in which the company uses technology to collect data and process them into information that can be used at every level of the organization.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s01_p01">By the time the company took the plunge and committed $100 million to marketing-related information technology (IT), Caesars had been collecting and storing data about customers for almost a decade. “While the company thought it important to collect customer information,” recalls a senior marketing executive, “the problem was we had millions of customers to collect information on, but we had no systematic way of turning it into a marketing decision. We didn’t know what to do with it.” In other words, Caesars was collecting a lot of <em class="emphasis">data</em> but not necessarily any <em class="emphasis">information</em>. So what’s the difference?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s01_p02">As an example, suppose that you want to know how you’re doing in a particular course. So far, you’ve taken two 20-question multiple-choice tests. On the first, you got questions 8, 11, and 14 wrong; on the second, you did worse, missing items 7, 15, 16, and 19. The items that you got wrong are merely <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">data</a><span class="glossdef">Unprocessed facts.</span></span>—unprocessed facts. What’s important is your total score. You scored 85 on the first exam and 80 on the second. These two numbers constitute <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">information</a><span class="glossdef">Data that have been processed or turned into some useful form.</span></span>—data that have been processed, or turned into some useful form. Knowing the questions that you missed simply supplied you with some data for calculating your scores.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s01_p03">Now let’s fast-forward to the end of the semester. At this point, in addition to taking the two tests, you’ve written two papers and taken a final. You got a 90 and 95 on the papers and a 90 on the final. You now have more processed data, but you still want to organize them into more useful information. What you want to know is your average grade for the semester. To get the information you want, you need yet more data—namely, the weight assigned to each graded item. Fortunately, you’ve known from day one that each test counts 20 percent, each paper 10 percent, and the final exam 40 percent. A little math reveals an average grade of 87.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s01_p04">Though this is the information you’re interested in, it may be mere data to your instructor, who may want different information: an instructor who intends to scale grades, for example, will want to know the average grade for the entire class. You’re hoping that the class average is low enough to push your average of 87 up from a B+ to an A– (or maybe even an A—it doesn’t hurt to hope for the best). The moral of the story is that what constitutes <em class="emphasis">information</em> at one stage can easily become <em class="emphasis">data</em> at another: or, one person’s information can be another person’s data.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s01_p05">As a rule, you want information; data are good only for generating the information. So, how do you convert data into information that’s useful in helping you make decisions and solve problems? That’s the question we’ll explore in the next section.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Information Systems</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s01_s01_p01">To gather and process data into information and distribute it to people who need it, organizations develop an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">information system (IS)</a><span class="glossdef">Computer system for gathering and processing data into information and distributing it to people who need it.</span></span>—the combination of technologies, procedures, and people who collect and distribute the information needed to make decisions and coordinate and control company-wide activities.

            <li>Determining the information needs of members of the organization</li>

        <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Differences in Information Needs</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s01_s01_s01_p01">The job is complicated by the fact that information needs vary according to different levels, operational units, and functional areas. Consider, for instance, the information needs of managers at several levels:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch15_s01_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Top managers</em> need information for planning, setting objectives, and making major strategic decisions.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Middle managers</em> need information that helps them allocate resources and oversee the activities under their control.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">First-line managers</em> require information that helps them supervise employees, oversee daily operations, and coordinate activities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s01_s01_s01_p02"><a class="xref" href="#collins-ch15_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 15.1 "Information Needs and Flows"</a> illustrates a hypothetical hierarchy of information needs at Caesars. The president, for example, needs information to determine whether profitability is up or down or if the organization is facing any new competitive threats. At the vice-presidential level, executives need information that will help them in controlling and planning for specific areas of operations. The VP of casino operations, for example, might need to know which operations are most profitable—slots, table games, or other gaming activities. The VP of hotel operations might want to know whether room revenues are going up or down.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s01_s01_s01_p03">The information needs of middle-level and lower-level managers are different still. The slot-machine manager might want to know whether the placement of machines on the casino floor affects profitability. The poker manager might want to know whether all table games comply with state regulations. At a lower level, the pit manager (who’s in charge of table games in a particular area) needs to know whether there’s a card-counter at his blackjack table or whether a dealer’s activities are suspicious.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s01_s01_s01_p04">Even at a given level, information needs can vary. A manager on the hotel side of the business, for instance, doesn’t care much about profitability at the poker tables, while a pit manager doesn’t have much use for hotel housekeeping reports. The reports that an accountant needs would hardly be the same as those needed by a human resources manager.</p>

        <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s01_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Need to Share Information</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s01_s01_s02_p01">Having stressed the differences in information needs, we should pause to remind ourselves that the managerial levels, operations, and functions of every organization are intertwined, to a greater or lesser degree. If you’ll glance again at <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch15_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 15.1 "Information Needs and Flows"</a>, you’ll be reminded that organizations need to share information, that information must flow, and that it must flow in both directions, bottom-up and top-down. At Caesars, for instance, both casino and hotel managers are concerned about security, which is also of interest to managers in different functional areas. Information supplied by the security group is obviously vital to managers in the gaming areas, but HR managers also need it to screen potential employees. Marketing information is clearly important to both casino and hotel operations: to maximize overall profits, the company uses marketing data to fill hotel rooms with customers who spend big in the casinos.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111128-121247-982512">Jim Kilby, Jim Fox, and Anthony F. Lucas, <em class="emphasis">Casino Operations and Management</em>, 2nd ed. (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005), 183–84.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s01_s01_s02_p02">Caesars’s information needs entail more than allowing individuals in a given casino to share information; information has to be shared among all of Caesars’s thirty-nine casinos. Thus, Caesars relies on an <em class="emphasis">integrated IT system</em> that allows real-time communication among all its properties. Installing the system (in the mid-1990s) was complicated, and not everyone in the organization liked the idea. Some managers felt that information sharing threatened their independence. Others, including some in the IT group, doubted that a large number of separate IT systems could be adequately integrated. To get everyone on board, John Bushy, then senior VP of information technology, pledged that he wouldn’t cut his hair until the system was up and running. By the time it was operational in 1997, Bushy had hair down to his shoulders, but it was worth it: Caesars’s ability to share real-time information across all its properties has been a major factor in the company’s success. Caesars’s new system cut costs by $20 million a year, increased brand recognition, and increased the number of customers playing at more than one Caesars property by 72 percent.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111205-140758-355699">Meridith LeVinson, “Jackpot!

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s01_s01_s03_p01">Many large and mid-size companies rely on a highly integrated system called an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">enterprise resource planning (ERP) system</a><span class="glossdef">Integrated computer system used to channel information to multiple users.</span></span> to channel information to multiple users. To understand what an ERP system does, forget about the P for <em class="emphasis">planning</em> (it really doesn’t have much to do with planning) and the R for <em class="emphasis">resource</em> (it’s an imprecise term). Focus on the E for <em class="emphasis">enterprise</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_004">Christopher Koch, “The ABCs of ERP,” <em class="emphasis">CIO.com</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://wikifab.dimf.etsii.upm.es/wikifab/images/d/da/The_ABCs_of_ERP.pdf">http://wikifab.dimf.etsii.upm.es/wikifab/images/d/da/The_ABCs_of_ERP.pdf</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span> An ERP system integrates the computer needs of all activities <em class="emphasis">across the enterprise</em> into a single system that serves all users. Such broad integration isn’t a simple task, and you wouldn’t be the first person to wonder whether it wouldn’t be easier to give each department its own computer system. Salespeople, for example, need a system that tracks sales and generates sales reports. Meanwhile, manufacturing personnel don’t need to track sales but do need to track inventory. What’s the problem with stand-alone computer systems? Quite simply, users in various departments can’t share information or communicate with each other.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">What If You Don’t Have ERP?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s01_s01_s04_p01">Imagine that you’re a sales manager for a fairly large manufacturing company that produces and sells treadmills. Like every other department in the organization, you have your own computer system. A local sporting-goods store orders one hundred treadmills through a regional sales representative. It’s your job to process the order. It wouldn’t be much of a problem for you to go into your computer and place the order. But how would you know if the treadmills were actually in stock and when they could be delivered? How would you know if the customer’s credit was any good? You could call the warehouse and ask if the treadmills are in stock. If they are, you’d tell the warehouse manager that you’re placing an order and hope that the treadmills are still in stock by the time your order gets there two days later. While you’re at it, you’d better ask for an expected delivery date. As a final precaution, you should probably call the finance department and ask about your customer’s credit rating. So now you’ve done your job, and it can hardly be your fault that because the cost of manufacturing treadmills has gone up, accounting has recommended an immediate price increase that hasn’t shown up in your computer system yet.</p>

Then you could find out if there were one hundred treadmills in stock, the expected delivery date, your customer’s credit rating, and the current selling price—without spending most of the day exchanging phone calls, e-mails, text messages, and faxes. You’d be in a better position to decide whether you can give your customer credit, and you could promise delivery (at a correct price) on a specified date. <em class="emphasis">Then</em>, you’d enter the order into the system. The information that you entered would be immediately available to everyone else. The warehouse would know what needs to be shipped, to whom, and when. The accounting department would know that a sale had been made, the dollar amount, and where to send the bill. In short, everyone would have up-to-date information, and no one would have to reinput any data.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s02_p01">Did you ever think about how much data you yourself generate? Just remember what you went through to start college. First, you had to fill out application forms asking you about test scores, high school grades, extracurricular activities, and finances, plus demographic data about you and your family. Once you’d picked a college, you had to supply data on your housing preferences, the curriculum you wanted to follow, and the party who’d be responsible for paying your tuition. When you registered for classes, you gave more data to the registrar’s office. When you arrived on campus, you gave out still more data to have your ID picture taken, to get your computer and phone hooked up, to open a bookstore account, and to buy an on-campus food-charge card. Once you started classes, data generation continued on a daily basis: your food card and bookstore account, for example, tracked your various purchases, and your ID tracked your coming and going all over campus. And you generated grades.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s02_p02">And all these data apply to just one aspect of your life. You also generated data every time you used your credit card and your cell phone. Who uses all these data? How are they collected, stored, analyzed, and distributed in organizations that have various reasons for keeping track of you?</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Data and Databases</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s02_s01_p01">To answer such questions, let’s go back to our Caesars example. As we’ve seen, Caesars collects a vast amount of data. Its hotel system generates data when customers make reservations, check in, buy food and beverages, purchase stuff at shops, attend entertainment events, and even relax at the spa. In the casino, customers apply for rewards programs, convert cash to chips (and occasionally chips back to cash), try their luck at the tables and slots, and get complimentary drinks. Then, there are the data generated by the activities of the company itself: employees, for instance, generate payroll and benefits data, and retail operations generate data every time they buy or sell something. Moreover, if we added up all these data, we’d have only a fraction of the amount generated by the company’s gaming operations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s02_s01_p02">How does Caesars handle all these data? First of all, it captures and stores them in several <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">databases</a><span class="glossdef">Electronic collection of related data accessible to various users.</span></span>—electronic collections of related data that can be accessed by various members of the organization. Think of databases as filing cabinets that can hold massive amounts of organized information, such as revenues and costs from hotel activities, casino activities, and events reservations at each of Caesars facilities.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s02_s01_s01_p01">What if Caesars wants to target customers who generate a lot of revenue, by using a program designed to entice return visits? How would it identify and contact these people? Theoretically, it could search through the relevant databases—those that hold customer-contact information (such as name and address) and information about customer activity in the company’s hotels, casinos, and entertainment venues. It would be a start, perhaps, but it wouldn’t be very efficient. First of all, it would be time-consuming. Plus, what if the same data weren’t stored in a similar fashion in each database? In that case, it would be quite hard to combine the data in a meaningful way. To address this problem, Caesars managers will rely on a system like the one illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch15_s02_s01_s01_f01">Figure 15.3 "The Data Mining Process"</a>, which calls for moving all the relevant data into a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">data warehouse</a><span class="glossdef">Centralized database that stores data from several databases so they can be easily analyzed.</span></span>—a centralized database in which data from several databases are consolidated and organized so that they can be easily analyzed.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Data Mining and Customer Behavior</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s02_s01_s03_p01">By data-mining its customer-based data warehouse, Caesars’s management can discover previously unknown relationships between the general behavior of its customers and that of a certain group of customers (namely, the most profitable ones). Then, it can design incentives to appeal specifically to those people who will generate the most profit for the company.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s02_s01_s03_p02">To get a better idea of how data mining works, let’s simplify a description of the process at Caesars. First, we need to know how the casino gathered the data to conduct its preliminary analysis. Most customers who play the slots use a Caesars player’s card that offers incentives based on the amount of money that they wager on slot machines, video poker, and table games.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111128-122730-758588">Caesars, “Total Rewards,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.totalrewards.com/TotalRewards/RewardsAndBenefits.do?page=overview">https://www.totalrewards.com/TotalRewards/RewardsAndBenefits.do?page=overview</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span> To get the card, a customer must supply some personal information, such as name, address, and phone number. From Caesars’s standpoint, the card is extremely valuable because it can reveal a lot about the user’s betting behavior: actual wins and losses, length of time played, preferred machines and coin denominations, average amount per bet, and—most important—the speed with which coins are deposited and buttons pushed.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111128-122730-758664">Robert L. Shook, <em class="emphasis">Jackpot! Harrah’s Winning Secrets for Customer Loyalty</em> (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003), 228–29.</span> As you can see from <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch15_s02_s01_s01_f01">Figure 15.3 "The Data Mining Process"</a>, Caesars’s primary data source was <em class="emphasis">internal</em>—generated by the company itself rather than provided by an outside source—and drew on a marketing database developed for <em class="emphasis">customer relationship management</em> (CRM).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s02_s01_s03_p03">What does the casino do with the data that it’s mined? Caesars was most interested in “first trippers”—first-time casino customers. In particular, it wanted to know which of these customers should be enticed to return. By analyzing the data collected from player’s-card applications and from customer’s actual play at the casino (even if for no more than an hour), Caesars could develop a profile of a profitable customer. Now, when a first-timer comes into any of its casinos and plays for a while, Caesars can instantly tell whether he or she fits the profitable-customer profile. To lure these people back for return visits, it makes generous offers of free or reduced-rate rooms, meals, entertainment, or free chips (the incentive of choice for Caesars’s preferred customers). These customers make up 26 percent of all Caesars’s customers and generate 82 percent of its revenues. Surprisingly, they’re not the wealthy high rollers to whom Caesars had been catering for years. Most of them are regular working people or retirees with available time and income and a fondness for slots. They generally stop at the casino on the way home from work or on a weekend night and don’t stay overnight. They enjoy the thrill of gambling, and you can recognize them because they’re the ones who can’t push the button or pump tokens in fast enough.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111202-100912-681578">Gary Loveman, “Diamonds in the Data Mine,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em>, May 2003, 3.</span></p>

</span> to help its casino salespeople connect to top customers on a more personal basis. Working from a prioritized list of customer names displayed on a computer screen, the salesperson clicks on a name to view relevant information about the customer, such as background and preferred casino activities. There’s even a printed script that can be used to guide the conversation. Such a system isn’t very helpful, however, to middle or top-level managers, who need systems to help them carry out their oversight and planning responsibilities. To design marketing programs, for instance, marketing managers rely on summary information gleaned from a dedicated customer-relationship management system.

Ever since the term was coined in 1956, artificial intelligence has always seemed on the verge of being “the next big thing.” Unfortunately, optimistic predictions eventually collided with underwhelming results, and many experts began to doubt that it would ever have profitable applications.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111128-124340-328629">“Artificial Intelligence,” <em class="emphasis">Webopedia</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/artificial_intelligence.html">http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/artificial_intelligence.html</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span> In the last decade, however, some significant advances have been made in artificial intelligence—albeit in the area of game playing, where activities are generally governed by small sets of well-defined rules. But even the game-playing environment is sometimes complex enough to promote interesting developments. In 1997, for example, IBM’s Deep Blue—a specialized computer with an advanced chess-playing program—defeated the world’s highest-ranked player.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111128-124340-328700">“Artificial Intelligence,” <em class="emphasis">Webopedia</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/artificial_intelligence.html">http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/artificial_intelligence.html</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s03_s02_s04_p02">More recently, several artificial intelligence applications have been successfully put to commercial use. Let’s take a brief look at two of these: <em class="emphasis">expert systems</em> and <em class="emphasis">face-recognition technology</em>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s03_s02_s05">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Expert Systems</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s03_s02_s05_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Expert systems</a><span class="glossdef">Program that mimics the judgment of experts.</span></span> are programs that mimic the judgment of experts by following sets of rules that experts would follow. They’re useful in such diverse areas as medical diagnosis, portfolio management, and credit assessment. For example, you’ve called the customer-service department of your credit-card company because you want to increase your credit line. Don’t expect to talk to some financial expert who’s authorized to say yes or no. You’ll be talking to a service representative with no financial expertise whatsoever. He or she will, however, have access to an expert system, which will give you an answer in a few seconds. How does it work? The expert system will prompt the representative to ask you certain questions about your salary and living expenses. It will also check internal corporate data to analyze your purchases and payment behavior, and, based on the results, it will determine whether you get an increase and, if so, how much.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s03_s02_s05_p02">At Caesars, an expert system called the Revenue Management System helps to optimize the overall profitability of both hotel and casino operations. When a customer requests a room, the program accesses his or her profile in the database and consults certain “rules” for assessing the application.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111128-124533-245351">John Goff, “Head Games: Businesses Deploying Analytical Software to Get a Better Fix on Customer Behavior,” <em class="emphasis">CFO Magazine for Senior Financial Executives</em> 20:9, July 1, 2004, <a class="link" href="http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3014815">http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3014815</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span> One rule, for example, might be, “If the customer has wagered more than $100,000 in the past year, add 10 points.” Eventually, the system decides whether your application will be accepted (and at what rate) by adding up points determined by the rules. While a tightwad may not get a room even when there are vacancies, a high roller may get a good rate on a luxury suite even if the hotel is nearly full.</p>

        <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s03_s02_s06">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Face-Recognition Technology</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s03_s02_s06_p01">Caesars uses another particularly interesting, and sophisticated, application of artificial intelligence. In the hotel-casino business, it’s crucial to identify and turn away undesirable visitors. One tool for this task is a digital camera-surveillance system that uses <em class="emphasis">face-recognition technology</em>. Using this technology, a program classifies a person’s face according to the presence/absence or extent of certain unique features, such as dimpled chins, receding jaws, overbites, and long or short noses. If there’s a match on, for example, fifteen features between a person being scanned and someone in the company database, a staff member decides whether the two people are the same. If a security manager then concludes that the face belongs to a skilled card-counter, the customer will be discouraged from playing blackjack; if it belongs to a known cheater, the individual will be escorted out of the casino. The system, however, does more than spot undesirables. It can also identify high rollers and send information about customers to managers on the floor. That’s why a Caesars manager can greet a preferred customer at the door with his favorite drink and a personalized greeting, such as “Hi, Bill! How’s Karen? Did you ever get that vintage Corvette? Here, have a gin rickey on the house.”<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111128-124626-267687">See Daintry Duffy, “Technology’s Winning Hand,” <em class="emphasis">CSO.online</em>, October 1, 2003, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.csoonline.com/article/218574/catching-casino-cheats-technology-s-winning-hand">http://www.csoonline.com/article/218574/catching-casino-cheats-technology-s-winning-hand</a> (accessed November 14, 2011); Larry Barrett Gallagher and Sean Gallagher, “NORA and ANNA: Non-Obvious Relationship Awareness,” <em class="emphasis">Baseline</em>, April 4, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.baselinemag.com/c/a/Past-News/NORA-and-ANNA/">http://www.baselinemag.com/c/a/Past-News/NORA-and-ANNA/</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span></p>

Now, the store may have one computer and everyone could share it. It’s more likely, however, that there are a number of computers (several for salespeople, one for delivery, and one for bookkeeping).

When IT professionals diagrammed computer systems, they used a cloud symbol to represent the Internet. So when you hear or read that an individual or company is using the “cloud” or technology firms, such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Salesforce.com, are offering cloud services, just substitute the word “Internet” for “cloud” and things will make sense.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s04_s01_s99_p98">You might be surprised to learn that you’re already using the cloud—that is if you use Facebook (which is very likely—in fact, just mentioning Facebook here might prompt you to stop studying and check out your friends’ pages).

Now imagine you’re Katrina Lane, senior vice president and chief technology officer for Caesars Entertainment, who is responsible for the information technology needed to handle multiple tasks in all these functional areas. You’re sitting at your desk when Gary Loveman, chief executive officer of Caesars, walks in and gives you the news. Caesars just purchased the Planet Hollywood Casino and Resort in Las Vegas and will open up two new casinos in Ohio in 2012.

Wouldn’t it make more sense to rent the use of the Microsoft Word program from a cloud vendor for say $5 a month (or $60 a year)? Given that the average time between new releases of Word is two years, your total cost per PC would be $120 (2 × $60)—a savings of about $230 per PC ($350 − $120). Your employees wouldn’t mind; instead of working offline, they would just login to the Internet and work with their online version using the files that were saved for them. And the members of your IT staff would be pleased that they wouldn’t need to install the new version of Word on all your PCs.</p>

<em class="emphasis">Speed of Delivery</em>—Purchasing and installing software and data processing equipment can be time consuming. A cloud computing service provider could get Caesars’s applications up and running in only a few weeks.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Scalable</em>—Caesars is constantly expanding both in the number of casinos it owns and geographically. In this ever-changing environment, it’s difficult to gauge the level of our technology needs. If we overestimate our requirements, we end up paying for technology we don’t need. If we underestimate, efficiency goes down, and the experience for our customers diminishes. By using cloud computing we are able to have exactly what we need at our disposal at any point in time.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Employees Can Be Mobile</em>—The use of cloud computing will free workers from their desks and allow them to work wherever they are. As applications move to the cloud, all that is needed for our employees to connect to their “offices” is the Internet. This mobility benefit also makes it easier for employees to collaborate on projects and connect with others in the company.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Information Technology Staff</em>—Although our current staff is extremely qualified and dedicated, finding experienced and knowledgeable staff is a continuing problem particularly in the casino industry which suffers from historically high turnover. By using cloud computing, we reduce our human resource needs by shifting some of our work to outside vendors who are able to hire and keep well qualified individuals (in part because IT professionals enjoy working for technology companies).</li>

<em class="emphasis">Disruption in Internet Service</em>—If Caesars moves some of its applications to the cloud, its employees can work on these applications on any device and in any location as long as they have an Internet connection. But what if the Internet is unavailable because of a disruption? Depending on the length of the disruption, this could create serious problems for Caesars.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Security</em>—Many companies are reluctant to trust cloud service providers with their data because they’re afraid it might become available to unauthorized individuals or criminals.

The Web is a subsystem of computers that can be accessed on the Internet using a special protocol, or language, known as <em class="emphasis">hypertext transfer protocol</em> (HTTP). What’s the difference between the Internet and the Web? According to Tim Berners-Lee (one of the small team of scientists who developed the concept for the Web in 1989), the Internet is a network of networks composed of cables and computers. You can use it to send “packets” of information from one computer to another, much like sending a postcard. If the address on the packet is accurate, it will arrive at the correct destination in much less than a second. Thus, the Internet is a packet-delivery <em class="emphasis">service</em> that delivers such items as e-mail messages all over the globe. The Web, by contrast, is composed of <em class="emphasis">information</em>—documents, pictures, sounds, streaming videos, and so on. It’s connected not through cables, but rather through <em class="emphasis">hypertext links</em> that allow users to navigate between resources on the Internet.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_017">Richard T.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s05_s01_p03">Because it’s driven by programs that communicate between computers connected to the Internet, the Web couldn’t exist without the Internet. The Internet, on the other hand, could exist without the Web, but it wouldn’t be nearly as useful. The Internet itself is enormous, but it’s difficult to navigate, and it has no pictures, sounds, or streamed videos. They exist on computers connected to the Web, which also makes it much easier to retrieve information. The creation of Web <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">browsers</a><span class="glossdef">Software (such as Internet Explorer) that locates and displays Web pages.</span></span>—software, such as Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, that locates and displays Web pages—opened up the Internet to a vast range of users.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s05_s03_s02_p01">Imagine a company that retails products for schoolteachers over the Internet—for example, books, software, and teaching supplies purchased from various manufacturers and distributors. It would need facilities to store inventories and personnel to handle inventories and fill customer orders. But what if this company decided to get out of the traditional retail business? What if it decided instead to team up with three trading partners—a book publisher, a software developer, and a manufacturer of office supplies? Our original company could re-create itself as a Web site for marketing the books, software, and supplies provided by its partners, without taking physical possession of them. It would become a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">virtual company</a><span class="glossdef">Company without a significant physical presence that relies on third parties to produce, warehouse, price, and deliver the products it sells over the Internet.</span></span>. Its partners would warehouse their own products and furnish product descriptions, prices, and delivery times. Meanwhile, the virtual company, besides promoting all three lines of products, would verify customer orders and forward them to its partners, who would ship their own products directly to customers. All four partners would be better off, because they’d be competing in a business in which none of them could compete by itself. This business approach has allowed <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://Spun.com">Spun.com</a>, a CD, DVD, and game Internet retailer, to avoid carrying the $8 million inventory that it would have needed to support its sales.

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s06_p01">E-commerce has presented businesses with opportunities undreamt of only a couple of decades ago. But it also has introduced some unprecedented challenges. For one thing, companies must now earmark more than 5 percent of their annual IT budgets for protecting themselves against disrupted operations and theft due to computer crime and sabotage.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111128-144859-666183">Steve Alexander, “Feds Take Up Arms as Computer Crime Becomes Multibillion-Dollar Problem,” <em class="emphasis">Minneapolis Star Tribune</em>, Computer Crime Research Center, <a class="link" href="http://www.crime-research.org/news/2003/10/Mess0601.html">http://www.crime-research.org/news/2003/10/Mess0601.html</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span> The costs resulting from cyber crimes—criminal activity done using computers or the Internet—are substantial and increasing at an alarming rate. A 2010 study of forty-five large U.S. companies revealed that the median cost of cybercrime for the companies in the study was $3.8 million a year.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_046">“First Annual Cost of Cyber Crime Study: Benchmark Study of U.S. Companies,” Ponemon Institute, July 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.riskandinsurancechalkboard.com/uploads/file/Ponemon%20Study%281%29.pdf">http://www.riskandinsurancechalkboard.com/uploads/file/Ponemon%20Study%281%29.pdf</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span> And some cybercrimes involve viruses that can spread rapidly from computer to computer creating enormous damage. It’s estimated, for example, that damage to 50,000 personal computers and corporate networks from the so-called Blaster worm in August 2003 totaled $2 billion, including $1.2 billion paid by Microsoft to correct the problem.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111128-144859-666250">Paul Shukovsky, “Blaster Worm Attacker Gets 18 Months,” <em class="emphasis">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Blaster-worm-attacker-gets-18-months-1165231.php">http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Blaster-worm-attacker-gets-18-months-1165231.php</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span> The battle against technology crime is near the top of the FBI’s list of priorities, behind only the war against terrorism and espionage.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111128-144859-666280">Steve Alexander, “Feds Take Up Arms as Computer Crime Becomes Multibillion-Dollar Problem,” <em class="emphasis">Minneapolis Star Tribune</em>, Computer Crime Research Center, <a class="link" href="http://www.crime-research.org/news/2003/10/Mess0601.html">http://www.crime-research.org/news/2003/10/Mess0601.html</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span> In addition to protecting their own operations from computer crime, companies engaged in e-commerce must clear another hurdle: they must convince consumers that it’s safe to buy things over the Internet—that credit-card numbers, passwords, and other personal information are protected from theft or misuse. In this section, we’ll explore some of these challenges and describe a number of the efforts being made to meet them.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s06_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Data Security</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s06_s01_p01">In some ways, life was simpler for businesspeople before computers. Records were produced by hand and stored on paper. As long as you were careful to limit access to your records (and remembered to keep especially valuable documents in a safe), you faced little risk of someone altering or destroying your records. In some ways, storing and transmitting data electronically is a little riskier. Let’s look at two data-security risks associated with electronic communication: <em class="emphasis">malicious programs</em> and <em class="emphasis">spoofing</em>.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s06_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Malicious Programs</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s06_s01_s01_p01">Some people get a kick out of wreaking havoc with computer systems by spreading a variety of destructive programs. Once they’re discovered, they can be combated with antivirus programs that are installed on most computers and that can be updated daily. In the meantime, unfortunately, they can do a lot of damage, bringing down computers or entire networks by corrupting operating systems or databases.</p>
            <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s06_s01_s01_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Viruses, Worms, and Trojan Horses</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s06_s01_s01_s01_p01">The cyber vandal’s repertory includes “viruses,” “worms,” and “Trojan horses.” Viruses and worms are particularly dangerous because they can copy themselves over and over again, eventually using up all available memory and closing down the system. Trojan horses are viruses that enter your computer by posing as some type of application. Some sneak in by pretending to be virus-scanning programs designed to rid your computer of viruses. Once inside, they do just the opposite.</p>

        <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s06_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Spoofing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s06_s01_s02_p01">It’s also possible for unauthorized parties to gain access to restricted company Web sites—usually for the purpose of doing something illegal. Using a technique called “spoofing,” culprits disguise their identities by modifying the address of the computer from which the scheme has been launched. Typically, the point is to make it look as if an incoming message has originated from an authorized source. Then, once the site’s been accessed, the perpetrator can commit fraud, spy, or destroy data. You could, for example, spoof a manufacturing firm with a false sales order that seems to have come from a legitimate customer. If the spoof goes undetected, the manufacturer will incur the costs of producing and delivering products that were never ordered (and will certainly never be paid for).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s06_s01_s02_p02">Every day, technically savvy thieves (and dishonest employees) steal large sums of money from companies by means of spoofing or some other computer scheme. It’s difficult to estimate the dollar amount because many companies don’t even know how much they’ve lost.</p>

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s06_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Revenue Theft</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s06_s02_p01">In addition to the problems of data security faced by every company that stores and transmits information electronically, companies that sell goods or provide services online are also vulnerable to activities that threaten their revenue sources. Two of the most important forms of computer crime are <em class="emphasis">denial of service</em> and <em class="emphasis">piracy</em>.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s06_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Denial of Service</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s06_s02_s01_p01">A denial-of-service attack does exactly what the term suggests: it prevents a Web server from servicing authorized users. Consider the following scenario. Dozens of computers are whirring away at an online bookmaker in the offshore gambling haven of Costa Rica. Suddenly a mass of blank incoming messages floods the company’s computers, slowing operations to a trickle. No legitimate customers can get through to place their bets. A few hours later, the owner gets an e-mail that reads, “If you want your computers to stay up and running through the football season, wire $40,000 to each of 10 numbered bank accounts in Eastern Europe.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s06_s02_s01_p02">You’re probably thinking that our choice of online gambling as an example of this scheme is a little odd, but we chose it because it’s real: many companies in the online-gambling industry suffer hundreds of such attacks each year.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111128-145023-443306">Stephen Baker and Brian Grow, “Gambling Sites, This Is a Holdup,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek Online</em>, August 9, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_32/b3895106_mz063.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_32/b3895106_mz063.htm</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span> Because most gambling operations opt to pay the ransom and get back to business as usual, denial of service to businesses in the industry has become a very lucrative enterprise.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s06_s02_s01_p03">Online gambling operations are good targets because they’re illegal in the United States, where they can’t get any help from law-enforcement authorities. But extortionists have been known to hit other targets, including Microsoft and the Recording Industry Association of America. The problem could become much more serious if they start going after e-commerce companies and others that depend on incoming orders to stay afloat.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s06_s02_s02_p01">Technology makes it easier to create and sell intellectual property, but it also makes it easier to steal it. Because digital products can be downloaded and copied almost instantly over the Internet, it’s a simple task to make perfect replicas of your favorite copyright-protected songs, movies, TV shows, and computer software, whether for personal use or further distribution. When you steal such materials, you’re cheating the countless musicians, technicians, actors, programmers, and others involved in creating and selling them. Theft cuts into sales and shrinks corporate profits, often by staggering amounts. Entertainment-industry analysts estimate that $30 billion worth of songs were illegally downloaded in the five year period ending in 2009.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_047">“For Students Doing Reports,” Recording Industry Association of America, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.riaa.com/faq.php">http://www.riaa.com/faq.php</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span> The software industry estimates that the global market for pirated software reached $59 billion in 2010.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111128-145147-445442">Zach Epstein, “Global Market for Pirated Software Reaches $59 billion,” BGR Innovation, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/05/12/global-market-for-pirated-software-reaches-59-billion/">http://www.bgr.com/2011/05/12/global-market-for-pirated-software-reaches-59-billion/</a> (accessed November 14, 2011). </span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s06_s02_s02_s01_p01">Builders install firewalls (or fireproof walls) in structures to keep a fire that starts in one part of a building from entering another part. Companies do something similar to protect their computer systems from outside intruders: they install virtual firewalls—software and hardware systems that prevent unauthorized users from accessing their computer networks.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s06_s02_s02_s01_p02">You can think of the firewall as a gatekeeper that stands at the entry point of the company’s network and monitors incoming and outgoing traffic. The firewall system inspects and screens all incoming messages to prevent unwanted intruders from entering the system and causing damage. It also regulates outgoing traffic to prevent employees from inappropriately sending out confidential data that shouldn’t leave the organization.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s06_s03_p01">Many people still regard the Internet as an unsafe place to do business. They worry about the security of credit-card information and passwords and the confidentiality of personal data. Are any of these concerns valid? Are you really running risks when you shop electronically? If so, what’s being done to make the Internet a safer place to conduct transactions? Let’s look a little more closely at the sort of things that tend to bother some Internet users (or, as the case may be, nonusers), as well as some of the steps that companies are taking to convince people that e-commerce is safe.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s06_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Credit-Card Theft</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s06_s03_s01_p01">One of the more serious barriers to the growth of e-commerce is the perception of many people that credit-card numbers can be stolen when they’re given out over the Internet. Though virtually every company takes considerable precautions, they’re not entirely wrong. Cyber criminals, unfortunately, seem to be tirelessly creative. One popular scheme involves setting up a fraudulent Internet business operation to collect credit-card information. The bogus company will take orders to deliver goods—say, Mother’s Day flowers—but when the day arrives, it will have disappeared from cyberspace. No flowers will get delivered, but even worse, the perpetrator can sell or use all the collected credit-card information.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s06_s03_s02_p01">Many people also fear that Internet passwords—which can be valuable information to cyber criminals—are vulnerable to theft. Again, they’re not altogether wrong. There are schemes dedicated entirely to stealing passwords. In one, the cyber thief sets up a Web site that you can access only if you register, provide an e-mail address, and select a password. The cyber criminal is betting that the site will attract a certain percentage of people who use the same password for just about everything—ATM accounts, e-mail, employer networks. Having finagled a password, the thief can try accessing other accounts belonging to the victim. So, one day you have a nice cushion in your checking account, and the next you’re dead broke.</p>

When you go back to the same site, your browser returns the information, telling the site who you are and confirming that you’ve been there before. The problem is not that the cookie can identify you in the same way as a name or an address. It is, however, linked to other information about you—such as the goods you’ve bought or the services you’ve ordered online. Before long, someone will have compiled a profile of your buying habits. The result? You’ll soon be bombarded with advertisements targeted to your interests. For example, let’s suppose you check out the Web site for an online diet program. You furnish some information but decide that the program is not for you. The next time you log on, you may be greeted by a pop-up pushing the latest miracle diet.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s06_s04_p01">So, what can companies do to ease concerns about the safety of Internet transactions? First, businesses must implement internal controls for ensuring adequate security and privacy. Then, they must reassure customers that they’re competent to safeguard credit-card numbers, passwords, and other personal information. Among the most common controls and assurance techniques, let’s look at <em class="emphasis">encryption</em> and <em class="emphasis">seals of assurance</em>.</p>

Here’s a simplified example: You want to send a note to a friend on the other side of the classroom, but you don’t want anyone else to know what it says. You and your friend could devise a code in which you substitute each letter in the message with the letter that’s two places before it in the alphabet. So you write A as C and B as D and so on. Your friend can decode the message, but it’ll look like nonsense to anyone else. This is an oversimplification of the process. In the real world, it’s much more complicated: data are scrambled using a complex code, the key for unlocking it is an algorithm, and you need certain computer hardware to perform the encryption/decryption process.</p>

At Kraft Foods, for example, IS professionals can focus on one of two areas: applications development (a management focus) and information technology (a technology focus). “Applications development,” according to the company itself, “calls for an ability to analyze [Kraft’s] clients’ needs and translate them into systems applications. Information technology calls for the ability to convert business systems specifications into technical specifications and to provide guidance and technical counsel to other Kraft professionals.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn15_035">“Careers at Kraft: Information Systems,” Kraft Foods, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.kraftfoods.com/careers/careers/systems.htm">http://www.kraftfoods.com/careers/careers/systems.htm</a> (accessed June 2, 2006).</span> Despite the differences in focus, Kraft encourages IS specialists to develop expertise in both areas.

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch15_s08_p12">Hewlett-Packard (HP) provides technology solutions to individuals, businesses, and institutions around the world. It generates annual revenues of $80 billion from the sale of IT products, including computers, printers, copiers, digital photography, and software. Anyone in the United States who wants to buy an HP product, get technical support, download software, learn about the company, or apply for a job can simply go to the HP Web site. But what if you live in Hong Kong? How would you get answers to your questions? You’d do the same thing as people in this country do—go to HP’s Web site.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch15_s08_p13">Try to imagine, however, the complex process of developing and maintaining a Web site that serves the needs of customers in more than seventy countries. To get a better idea, go to the HP Web site (<a class="link" href="http://www.hp.com">http://www.hp.com</a>). Start by looking at HP’s line of notebooks and checking its prices. Then, review the company information (click on “About HP” in the bottom right) that’s posted on the site, and, finally, look for a job—it’s good practice (click on “Jobs” in the bottom right).</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch15_s08_p14">Now pretend that you live in Hong Kong and repeat the process. Start by going to the same HP Web site (<a class="link" href="http://www.hp.com">http://www.hp.com</a>). Click on the United States (next to U.S. flag in the bottom left) and then Asia and Oceania. If you can read Chinese, click on “Hong Kong—Traditional Chinese.” Otherwise, click on “Hong Kong—English.” Then, answer the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch15_s08_l06">
            <li>How easy was it to navigate the site and to switch back and forth between the U.S. and Hong Kong sections of the site?</li>
            <li>Identify at least five differences between the two sections.</li>
            <li>Does HP’s Web site meet the needs of customers in both the United States and Hong Kong? Why, or why not? How could it be improved?</li>
