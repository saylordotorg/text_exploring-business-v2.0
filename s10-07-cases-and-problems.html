        <p class="para" id="collins-ch06_s07_p01">A mission statement tells customers, employees, and stakeholders why the organization exists—its purpose. It can be concise, like the one from Mary Kay Cosmetics—“To enrich the lives of women around the world”—or it can be more detailed, such as the following from FedEx:</p>

            <p class="para" id="collins-ch06_s07_p02">FedEx Corporation will produce superior financial returns for its shareowners by providing high value-added logistics, transportation and related business services through focused operating companies. Customer requirements will be met in the highest quality manner appropriate to each market segment served. FedEx will strive to develop mutually rewarding relationships with its employees, partners and suppliers. Safety will be the first consideration in all operations. Corporate activities will be conducted to the highest ethical and professional standards.</p>

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch06_s07_p03">Mission statements are typically constructed to communicate several pieces of information: what the company strives to accomplish, what it’s known for, and how it serves its customers. Here are a few examples:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="collins-ch06_s07_l05">
            <li>The Hershey Company: Bringing sweet moments of Hershey happiness to the world every day.</li>

A career in management may be for you, but be forewarned that there’s a downside: you have to make tough decisions, other people will be after your job, and it can be lonely at the top.

                    <strong class="emphasis bold">Sugarcoating the News at Krispy Kreme</strong>
                </p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch06_s07_p12">According to Krispy Kreme’s “Code of Ethics for Chief Executive and Senior Financial Officers,” the company’s top executives are expected to practice and promote honest, ethical conduct. They’re also responsible for the health and overall performance of the company. Recently, however, things have gone wrong in the top echelons of the doughnut-shop chain.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch06_s07_p13">First, a little background. Founded as one small doughnut shop in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in 1937, the brand became increasingly popular over the next six decades, taking off in the 1980s and 1990s. By 2003, Krispy Kreme (which went public in 2000) was selling more than a billion doughnuts a year. That’s when things started to go stale. (For more details on the company’s ups and downs, go to <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/apnews/stories/012205/D87OTSIG0.shtml">http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/apnews/stories/012205/D87OTSIG0.shtml</a> and read the article “Krispy Kreme: The Rise, Fall, Rise and Fall of a Southern Icon.”)</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch06_s07_p14">When sales first started to decline in the fall of 2003, CEO Scott Livengood offered a variety of creative explanations, mostly for the benefit of anxious investors: high gas prices discouraged people from driving to doughnut shops; supermarket sales were down because grocery stores were losing business to Wal-Mart; people were cutting back on carbohydrates because of the popular Atkins diet. Unfortunately, other (more plausible) explanations were beginning to surface. To complete this exercise, you’ll need to find out what they were. Go to both <a class="link" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/toc/05_02/B39150502manager.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/toc/05_02/B39150502manager.htm</a> and <a class="link" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2005-08-10-krispy-kreme_x.htm?POE=MONISVA">http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2005-08-10-krispy-kreme_x.htm?POE=MONISVA</a> to link to the <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em> and USA <em class="emphasis">Today</em> Web sites, and then read these articles: “The Best and Worst Managers of the Year” and “Krispy Kreme Must Restate Earnings by $25.6M.” Once you have a good grasp of the company’s problems and you’ve read about the people who are responsible, answer the following questions, being sure to provide explanations for your responses:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch06_s07_l02">
            <li>What factors contributed to the problems at Krispy Kreme? What happened to the company? Who was hurt?</li>
            <li>Should the firm’s problems be attributed to poor management, unethical behavior on the part of the executive team, or both?</li>
            <li>Judging from the lessons of the Krispy Kreme case, how important do you think it is for a firm to have strong top-down leadership?</li>
            <li>If you’d been the CEO of Krispy Kreme, what things would you have done differently?</li>

The director of sales retained responsibility for the United States, while a new director was added for Asia. The two salespeople who had been with the company since its beginning focused on U.S. sales, and two new salespeople were hired to handle Asia. No other position changed, and for the next two years, all personnel worked out of the U.S. headquarters.</p>

At this point, management decided to set up two separate operations—one in the United States and the other in China. A senior VP was hired to head each operation—senior VP of U.S. operations and senior VP of Asian operations. Both would report to the CEO. Each operational unit would run its own production facilities, arrange its own financing, and be in charge of its sales and marketing activities.
