    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_p01">Joe isn’t old enough to qualify, but if his grandfather had deposited $1,000 in an account paying 7 percent interest in 1945, it would now be worth $64,000. That’s because money invested at 7 percent compounded will double every ten years. Now, $64,000 may or may not seem like a significant return over fifty years, but after all, the money did all the heavy lifting, and given the miracle of compound interest, it’s surprising that Americans don’t take greater advantage of the opportunity to multiply their wealth by saving more of it, even in modest, interest-bearing accounts. Ironically, with $790 billion in credit card debt, it’s obvious that a lot of American families are experiencing the effects of compound interest—but in reverse.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_031">Robert H.

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_p02">As a matter of fact, though Joe College appears to be on the right track when it comes to saving, many people aren’t. A lot of Americans, it seems, do indeed set savings goals, but in one recent survey, nearly 70 percent of the respondents reported that they fell short of their monthly goals because their money was needed elsewhere. About one-third of Americans say that they’re putting away something but not enough, and another third aren’t saving anything at all. Almost one-fifth of all Americans have net worth of zero—or less.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_032">Don Taylor, “Two-Thirds of Americans Don’t Save Enough,” <em class="emphasis">Bankrate.com</em>, October 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/retirement/Oct_07_retirement_poll_results_a1.asp">http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/retirement/Oct_07_retirement_poll_results_a1.asp</a> (accessed November 11, 2011); Robert H.

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_p03">As we indicated in the opening section of this chapter, this shortage of savings goes hand in hand with a surplus in spending. “My parents,” says one otherwise gainfully employed American knowledge worker, “are appalled at the way I justify my spending. I think, ‘Why work and make money unless you're going to enjoy it?’ That’s a fine theory,” she adds, “until you’re sixty, homeless, and with no money in the bank.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_033">Quoted by Marilyn Gardner, “Why Can’t Americans Save a Dime?” <em class="emphasis">Christian Science Monitor</em> (2008), <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mrshultz.com/webpages/whycantamericanssave.htm">http://www.mrshultz.com/webpages/whycantamericanssave.htm</a> (accessed November 11, 2011).</span> And indeed, if she doesn’t intend to alter her personal-finances philosophy, she has good reason to worry about her “older adult” years. Sixty percent of Americans over the age of sixty-five have less than $100,000 in savings, and only 30 percent of this group have more than $25,000; 45 percent have less than $15,000. As for income, 75 percent of people over age sixty-five generate less than $35,000 annually, and 30 percent are in the “poverty to near-poverty” range of $10,000 to $20,000 (as compared to 12 percent of the under-sixty-five population).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_034">Rose M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s01_p03">Now, a widespread tendency on the part of Americans to spend rather than save doesn’t account entirely for the downward shift in the savings rate. In late 2005, the Federal Reserve cited at least two other (closely related) factors in the decline of savings:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_036">Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, “Spendthrift Nation,” <em class="emphasis">Economic Research and Data</em>, November 10, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2005/el2005-30.html">http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2005/el2005-30.html</a> (accessed November 11, 2011).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s01_p04">Assume, for example, that, in addition to your personal savings, you own some stock and have a mortgage on a home. Both your stock and your home are (supposedly) <em class="emphasis">appreciable assets</em>—their value used to go up over time. (In fact, if you had taken out your mortgage in 2000, by the end of 2005 your home would have appreciated at double the rate of your disposable personal income.) The decline in the personal savings rate during the mid-2000s, suggested the Fed, resulted in part from people’s response to “long-lived bull markets in stocks and housing”; in other words, a lot of people had come to rely on the appreciation of such assets as stocks and residential property as “a substitute for the practice of saving out of wage income.”</p>

Subprime loans are made to borrowers who don’t qualify for market-set interest rates because of one or more risk factors—income level, employment status, credit history, ability to make only a very low down payment.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_p02">The repercussions? Banks and other institutions that made mortgage loans were the first sector of the financial industry to be hit. Largely because of mortgage-loan defaults, profits at more than 8,500 U.S. banks dropped from $35 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006 to $650 million in the corresponding quarter of 2007 (a decrease of 89 percent). Bank earnings for the year 2007 declined 31 percent and dropped another 46 percent in the first quarter of 2008.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_042">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, <em class="emphasis">Quarterly Banking Profile</em> (Fourth Quarter 2007), <a class="link" href="http://www.2.fdic.gov/qbp/2007dec/qbp.pdf">http://www.2.fdic.gov/qbp/2007dec/qbp.pdf</a> (accessed September 25, 2008); FDIC, <em class="emphasis">Quarterly Banking Profile</em> (First Quarter 2008), <a class="link" href="http://www.2.fdic.gov/qbp/2008mar/qbp.pdf">http://www.2.fdic.gov/qbp/2008mar/qbp.pdf</a> (accessed September 25, 2008).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_p03">Losses in this sector were soon felt by two publicly traded government-sponsored organizations, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). Both of these institutions are authorized to make loans and provide loan guarantees to banks, mortgage companies, and other mortgage lenders; their function is to make sure that these lenders have enough money to lend to prospective home buyers. Between them, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac backed approximately half of that $12 trillion in outstanding mortgage loans, and when the mortgage crisis hit, the stock prices of the two corporations began to drop steadily. In September 2008, amid fears that both organizations would run out of capital, the U.S. government took over their management.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_p04">Freddie Mac also had another function: to increase the supply of money available for mortgage loans and new home purchases, Freddie Mac bought mortgages already written by lenders, pooled them, and sold them as mortgage-backed securities to investors on the open market. Many major investment firms did much the same thing, buying individual subprime mortgages from original lenders (such as small banks), pooling the projected revenue—payments made by the original individual home buyers—and selling securities backed by the pooled revenue.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_p05">But when their rates went too high and home buyers couldn’t make these payments, these securities plummeted in value. Institutions that had invested in them—including investment banks—suffered significant losses.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_043">Shawn Tully, “Wall Street’s Money Machine Breaks Down,” <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>, <em class="emphasis">CNNMoney.com</em>, November 12, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/11/26/101232838/index.htm">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/11/26/101232838/index.htm</a> (accessed November 11, 2011).</span> In September 2008, one of these investment banks, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy protection; another, Merrill Lynch, agreed to sell itself for $50 billion. Next came American International Group (AIG), a giant insurance company that insured financial institutions against the risks they took in loaning and investing money. As its policyholders buckled under the weight of defaulted loans and failed investments, AIG, too, was on the brink of bankruptcy, and when private efforts to bail it out failed, the U.S. government stepped in with a loan of $85 billion.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_044">See Greg Robb et al., “AIG Gets Fed Rescue in Form of $85 Billion Loan,” <em class="emphasis">MarketWatch</em>, September 16, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/aig-gets-fed-rescue-form/story.aspx?guid=%7BE84A4797%2D3EA6%2D40B1%2D9DB5%2DF07B5A7F5BC2%7D">http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/aig-gets-fed-rescue-form/story.aspx?guid=%7BE84A4797%2D3EA6%2D40B1%2D9DB5%2DF07B5A7F5BC2%7D</a> (accessed November 11, 2011).</span> The U.S. government also agreed to buy up risky mortgage-backed securities from teetering financial institutions at an estimated cost of “hundreds of billions.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_045">Mortgage Bankers Association, “Delinquencies and Foreclosures Increase in Latest MBA National Delinquency Survey,” Press Release, September 5, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.mbaa.org/NewsandMedia/PressCenter/64769.htm">http://www.mbaa.org/NewsandMedia/PressCenter/64769.htm</a> (accessed November 11, 2011).</span></p>

If you defaulted on your subprime ARM, you may have suffered foreclosure on your newly acquired asset, lost any equity that you’d built up in it, and taken a hit in your credit rating. (We’ll assume that you’re not one of the people whose eagerness to get on the subprime bandwagon caused fraudulent mortgage applications to go up by 300 percent between 2002 and 2006.)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_046">Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, <em class="emphasis">Mortgage Loan Fraud: An Industry Assessment Based upon Suspicious Activity Report Analysis</em>, November 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/reports/pdf/MortgageLoanFraud.pdf">http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/reports/pdf/MortgageLoanFraud.pdf</a> (accessed November 11, 2011).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p02">On the other hand, you’ve probably learned a few lessons about financial planning and strategy. Let’s conclude with a survey of three lessons that you should have learned from your hypothetical adventure in the world of subprime mortgages.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p03"><em class="emphasis">Lesson 1: All mortgages are not created equal</em>. Despite (or perhaps because of) the understandable enticement of home ownership, your judgment may have been faulty in this episode of your financial life cycle. Generally speaking, you’re better off with a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fixed-rate mortgage</a><span class="glossdef">A mortgage on which the interest rate remains the same regardless of changes in market interest rates.</span></span>—one on which the interest rate remains the same regardless of changes in market interest rates—than with an ARM.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_047">See Arthur J. Keown, <em class="emphasis">Personal Finance: Turning Money into Wealth</em>, 4th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2007, 253–54.</span> As we’ve explained at length in this chapter, planning is one of the cornerstones of personal-finances management, and ARMs don’t lend themselves to planning. How well can you plan for your future mortgage payments if you can’t be sure what they’re going to be?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p04">In addition, though interest rates may go up or down, planning for them to go <em class="emphasis">down</em> and to take your mortgage payments with them doesn’t make much sense. You can wait around to get lucky, and you can even try to get lucky (say, by buying a lottery ticket), but you certainly can’t <em class="emphasis">plan</em> to get lucky. Unfortunately, the only thing you can really <em class="emphasis">plan</em> for is higher rates and higher payments. An ARM isn’t a good idea if you don’t know whether you can meet payments higher than your initial payment. In fact, if you have reason to believe that you can’t meet the <em class="emphasis">maximum</em> payment entailed by an ARM, you probably shouldn’t take it on.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p05"><em class="emphasis">Lesson 2: It’s risky out there</em>. You now know—if you hadn’t suspected it already—that planning your personal finances would be a lot easier if you could do it in a predictable economic environment. But you can’t, of course, and virtually constant instability in financial markets is simply one economic fact of life that you’ll have to deal with as you make your way through the stages of your financial life cycle.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p06">In other words, any foray into financial markets is risky.

<em class="emphasis">Management risk</em> is the risk that poor management of an organization with which you’re dealing may adversely affect the outcome of your personal-finances planning. If you couldn’t pay the higher rate on your ARM, managers at your lender probably failed to look deeply enough into your employment status and income.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Business risk</em> is the risk associated with a product that you’ve chosen to buy. The fate of your mortgagor, who issued the original product—your subprime ARM—and that of everyone down the line who purchased it in some form (perhaps Freddy Mac and Merrill Lynch) bear witness to the pitfalls of business risk.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Financial risk</em> refers to the risk that comes from ill-considered indebtedness. Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and several investment banks have felt the repercussions of investing too much money in financial instruments that were backed with shaky assets (namely, subprime mortgages).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p07">In your own small way, of course, you, too, underestimated the pitfalls of all three of these forms of risk.</p>

As you can see, the increase was dramatic—from 80 percent in the early 1990s to about 130 percent in 2007.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn14_050">“Getting Worried Downtown,” <em class="emphasis">Economist.com</em>, November 15, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10134077">http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10134077</a> (accessed November 11, 2011).</span> This rise was made possible by greater access to credit—people borrow money in order to spend it, whether on consumption or on investments, and the more they can borrow, the more they can spend.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_p09">In the United States, greater access to credit in the late 1990s and early 2000s was made possible by rising housing prices: the more valuable your biggest asset, the more lenders are willing to lend you, even if what you’re buying with your loan—your house—<em class="emphasis">is</em> your biggest asset. As the borrower, your strategy is twofold: (1) Pay your mortgage out of your wage income, and (2) reap the financial benefits of an asset that appreciates in value. On top of everything else, you can count the increased value of your asset as <em class="emphasis">savings</em>: when you sell the house at retirement, the difference between your mortgage and the current value of your house is yours to support you in your golden years.</p>

From a peak in mid-2006, they had fallen 8 percent by November 2007, and by April 2008 they were down from the 2006 peak by more than 19 percent—the worst rate of decline since the Great Depression. And most experts expected it to get worse before it gets better, and unfortunately they were right.

                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="collins-ch14_s04_s02_s01_l02">
                    <li>Personal saving suffered a steep decline from 1980 to 2005 and remained at this negligible savings rate until it started moving up in 2008. The recent increase in the savings rate, however, is still below the long-term average of 7 percent.</li>
                    <li>In addition to Americans’ tendency to spend rather than save, the Federal Reserve observed that a lot of people had come to rely on the appreciation of such assets as stocks and residential property as a substitute for the practice of saving out of wage income.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Subprime loans</strong> are made to would-be home buyers who don’t qualify for market-set interest rates because of one or more risk factors—income level, employment status, credit history, ability to make only a very low down payment. Interest rates may run from 8 percent to 10 percent and higher.</li>
                    <li>An <strong class="emphasis bold">adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)</strong> is a home loan pegged to the increase or decrease of certain interest rates that the lender has to pay. If those rates go up, the mortgage rate and the home buyer’s monthly payments go up, too. A <strong class="emphasis bold">fixed-rate mortgage</strong> is a home loan on which the interest rate remains the same regardless of changes in market interest rates.</li>
                    <li>In the years between 2001 and 2005, lenders made billions of dollars in subprime ARM loans to American home buyers. In 2006 and 2007, however, housing prices started to go down. Homeowners with subprime ARM loans weren’t able to refinance, their mortgage rates began going up, and foreclosures became commonplace.</li>
                    <li>In 2006 and 2007, largely because of mortgage-loan defaults, banks and other institutions that made mortgage loans began losing huge sums of money. These losses carried over to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, publicly traded government-sponsored organizations that make loans and provide loan guarantees to banks and other mortgage lenders.</li>
                    <li>Next to be hit were major investment firms that had been buying subprime mortgages from banks and other original lenders, pooling the projected revenue—payments made by the original individual home buyers—and selling securities backed by the pooled revenue. When their rates went too high and home buyers couldn’t make their house payments, these securities plummeted in value, and the investment banks and other institutions that had invested in them suffered significant losses.</li>
