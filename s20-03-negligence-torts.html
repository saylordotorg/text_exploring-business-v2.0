You and your roommate are being sued by the homeowner for a different type of tort—a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">negligence tort</a><span class="glossdef">Tort resulting from carelessness.</span></span>, which results not from intentional wrongdoing, but from <em class="emphasis">carelessness</em>. When he placed that can of paint at his feet, where he might easily dislodge it as he moved around the platform, your roommate allowed his conduct to fall below a certain standard of care—namely, the degree of care necessary to protect others from an unreasonable likelihood of harm.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Elements of a Negligence Claim</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s03_s01_p01">To prove that the act in question was negligent, the homeowner must demonstrate the four elements of a negligence claim:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_011">See Henry R. Cheesman, <em class="emphasis">Contemporary Business and Online Commerce Law: Legal, Internet, Ethical, and Global Environments</em>, 5th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2006), 79–83.</span></p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch16_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">That the defendant (your roommate and, ultimately, you) owed a</em> duty of care <em class="emphasis">to the plaintiff (the homeowner)</em>. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Duty of care</a><span class="glossdef">Basic obligation that one person owes another; duty not to cause harm or unreasonable risk of harm.</span></span> refers simply to the basic obligation that one person owes another—the duty not to cause harm or an unreasonable risk of harm.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">That the defendant</em> breached <em class="emphasis">his duty of care</em>. Once it has been determined that the defendant owed a duty of care, the court will ask whether he did indeed fail to perform that duty. Did he, in other words, fail to act as a reasonable person would act? (In your roommate’s case, by the way, it’s a question of acting as a reasonable <em class="emphasis">professional</em> would act.)</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">That the defendant’s</em> breach of duty of care <em class="emphasis">caused injury to the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s property</em>. If the bucket of paint had fallen on his own car, your roommate’s carelessness wouldn’t have been <em class="emphasis">actionable</em>—wouldn’t have provided cause for legal action—because the plaintiff (the homeowner) would have suffered no injury to person or property. What if the paint bucket had hit and shattered the homeowner’s big toe, thus putting an end to his career as a professional soccer player? In that case, you and your roommate would be looking at much higher damages. As it stands, the homeowner can seek compensation only to cover the damage to his car.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">That the defendant’s action did in fact cause the injury in question</em>. There must be a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the defendant’s action and the plaintiff’s injury. In law, this relationship is called a <em class="emphasis">cause in fact</em> or <em class="emphasis">actual cause</em>. For example, what if the homeowner had taken one look at his dented, paint-spattered car and collapsed from a heart attack? Would your roommate be liable for this injury to the plaintiff’s person? Possibly, though probably not. Most actions of any kind set in motion a series of consequent actions, and the court must decide the point beyond which a defendant is no longer liable for these actions. The last point at which the defendant is liable for negligence is called a <em class="emphasis">proximate cause</em> or <em class="emphasis">legal cause</em>. The standard for determining proximate cause is generally <em class="emphasis">foreseeability</em>. Your roommate couldn’t reasonably foresee the possibility that the owner of the car beneath his platform might have a heart attack as a result of some mishap with his paint bucket. Thus he probably wouldn’t be held liable for this particular injury to the plaintiff’s person.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s03_s02_p01">At this point, you yourself may still want to ask an important question: “<em class="emphasis">Why me</em>?” Why should <em class="emphasis">you</em> be held liable for negligence? Undoubtedly you owed your client (the homeowner) a duty of care, but you personally did nothing to breach that duty. And if you didn’t breach any duty of care, how could you have been the cause, either actual or proximate, of any injury suffered by your client? Where does he get off suing <em class="emphasis">you</em> for negligence?</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s03_s02_s01_p01">To answer these questions, we must enter an extremely important area of civil law—the law of contracts. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contract</a><span class="glossdef">Exchange of promises or exchange of a promise for an act.</span></span> is an exchange of promises or an exchange of a promise for an act, and because it involves an <em class="emphasis">exchange</em>, it obviously involves at least two parties. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch16_s03_s02_s01_f01">Figure 16.1 "Parties to a Contract"</a>, an <em class="emphasis">offeror</em> makes an offer to enter into a contract with an <em class="emphasis">offeree</em>. The offeror offers to do something in particular (or to refrain from doing something in particular), and if the offeree accepts this offer, a contract is created. As you can also see, both offer and acceptance must meet certain conditions.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s03_s02_s01_p02">A contract is <em class="emphasis">legally enforceable</em>: if one party fails to do what he or she has promised to do, the other can ask the courts to enforce the agreement or award damages for injury sustained because the contract has been <em class="emphasis">breached</em>—because a promise made under the contract hasn’t been kept or an act hasn’t been performed. A contract, however, can be enforced only if it meets four requirements:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_012">See Henry R. Cheesman, <em class="emphasis">Contemporary Business and Online Commerce Law: Legal, Internet, Ethical, and Global Environments</em>, 5th ed.

<em class="emphasis">Consideration</em>. Each promise must be made in return for the performance of a legally sufficient act or promise. If one party isn’t required to exchange something of legal value (e.g., money, property, a service), an agreement lacks sufficient consideration.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s03_s02_s02_p01">Here’s where you come in: an employment relationship like the one that you had with your roommate is a contract. Under this contract, both parties have certain duties (you’re obligated to compensate your roommate, for instance, and he’s obligated to perform his assigned tasks in good faith). The law assumes that, when performing his employment duties, your employee is under your <em class="emphasis">control</em>—that you control the time, place, and method of the work.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_014">See John Jude Moran, <em class="emphasis">Employment Law: New Challenges in the Business Environment</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008), 3.</span> This is a key concept in your case.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Respondeat Superior</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s03_s02_s02_s01_p01">U.S. law governing employer-employee contracts derives, in part, from English common law of the seventeenth century, which established the doctrine known as <em class="emphasis">respondeat superior</em>—“Let the master answer [for the servant’s actions].” This principle held that when a servant was performing a task for a master, the master was liable for any damage that the servant might do (a practical consideration, given that servants were rarely in any position to make financial restitution for even minor damages).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_015">See Nancy A. Kubasek, Bartley A. Brennan, and M. Neil Browne, <em class="emphasis">The Legal Environment of Business: A Critical Thinking Approach</em>, 5th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2009), 446; “Respondeat Superior,” <em class="emphasis">Law Library: American Law and Legal Information</em> (2008), <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/respondeat+superior">http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/respondeat+superior</a> (accessed November 12, 2011).</span> Much the same principle exists in contemporary U.S. employment law, which extends it to include the “servant’s” violations of tort law. Your client—the homeowner—has thus filed a <em class="emphasis">respondeat superior</em> claim of negligence against you as your roommate’s employer.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Scope of Employment</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s03_s02_s02_s02_p01">In judging your responsibility for the damages done to the homeowner’s car by your employee, the court will apply a standard known as <em class="emphasis">scope of employment</em>: an employee’s actions fall within the scope of his employment under two conditions: (1) if they are performed in order to fulfill contractual duties owed to his employer and (2) if the employer is (or could be) in some control, directly or indirectly, over the employee’s actions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_016">“Scope of Employment,” <em class="emphasis">Law Library: American Law and Legal Information</em> (2008), <a class="link" href="http://law.jrank.org/pages/10039/Scope-Employment.html">http://law.jrank.org/pages/10039/Scope-Employment.html</a> (accessed November 12, 2011).</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s03_s02_s02_s02_p02">If you don’t find much support in these principles for the idea that your roommate was negligent but you weren’t, that’s because there isn’t much. Your roommate was in fact your employee; he was clearly performing contractual duties when he caused the accident, and as his employer, you were, directly or indirectly, in control of his activities. You may argue that the contract with your roommate isn’t binding because it was never put in writing, but that’s irrelevant because employment contracts don’t have to be in writing.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_017">John Jude Moran, <em class="emphasis">Employment Law: New Challenges in the Business Environment</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008), 11.</span> You could remind the court that you repeatedly told your employee to put his paint bucket in a safer place, but this argument won’t carry much weight: in general, courts consider an employee’s forbidden acts to be within the scope of his employment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn16_018">Scope of Employment,” <em class="emphasis">Law Library: American Law and Legal Information</em> (2008), <a class="link" href="http://law.jrank.org/pages/10039/Scope-Employment.html">http://law.jrank.org/pages/10039/Scope-Employment.html</a> (accessed November 12, 2011).</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s03_s02_s02_s02_p03">On the other hand, the same principle protects you from liability in the assault-and-battery case against your roommate. The court will probably find that his aggressive response to the neighbor’s comment wasn’t related to the business at hand or committed within the scope of his employment; in responding to the neighbor’s insult to his intelligence, he was acting independently of his employment contract with you.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s03_s02_s02_s02_p04">Finally, now that we’ve taken a fairly detailed look at some of the ways in which the law works to make business relationships as <em class="emphasis">predictable</em> as possible, let’s sum up this section by reminding ourselves that the U.S. legal system is also <em class="emphasis">flexible</em>. In its efforts to resolve your case, let’s say that the court assesses the issues as follows:</p>
                <span class="blockquote block" id="collins-ch16_s03_s02_s02_s02_bl01">
                    <p class="para editable" id="collins-ch16_s03_s02_s02_s02_p05">“The damage to the homeowner’s car amounts to $3,000. He can’t recover anything from your roommate, who owns virtually nothing but his personal library of books on medieval theology. Nor can he recover anything from your business-liability insurer because you never thought your business would need any insurance (and couldn’t afford it anyway). So that leaves you: can the homeowner recover damages from you personally? Legally, yes: although you didn’t go through the simple formalities of creating a sole proprietorship (see <a class="xref" href="collins-ch04#collins-ch04">Chapter 4 "Selecting a Form of Business Ownership"</a>), you are nevertheless liable for the contracts and torts of your business. On the other hand, you’re not worth much more than your roommate, at least when it comes to financial assets. You have a six-year-old stereo system, a seven-year-old panel truck, and about $200 in a savings account—what’s left after you purchased the two ladders and the platform that you used as scaffolding. The court could order you to pay the $3,000 out of future earnings but it doesn’t have to. After all, the homeowner knew that you had no business-liability insurance but hired you anyway because he was trying to save money on the cost of painting his house. Moreover, he doesn’t have to pay the $3,000 out of his own pocket because his personal-property insurance will cover the damage to his car.”</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch16_s03_s02_s02_s02_p06">You should probably consider yourself lucky. Had your case gone to court, it would have been subject to the <em class="emphasis">rules of civil procedure</em> outlined in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch16_s03_s02_s02_s02_f01">Figure 16.2 "Stages in a Civil Lawsuit"</a>. As you might suspect, civil suits are time-consuming.
