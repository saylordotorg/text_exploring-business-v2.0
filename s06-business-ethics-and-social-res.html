        <h2 class="title editable block">“Mommy, Why Do You Have to Go to Jail?”</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s00_p01">The one question Betty Vinson would prefer to avoid is “Mommy, why do you have to go to jail?”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_001">This case is based on Susan Pullman, “How Following Orders Can Harm Your Career,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, June 23, 2003, <em class="emphasis">CareerJournal.com</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3010537/c_3036075">http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3010537/c_3036075</a> (accessed January 22, 2012).</span> Vinson graduated with an accounting degree from Mississippi State and married her college sweetheart. After a series of jobs at small banks, she landed a midlevel accounting job at WorldCom, at the time still a small long-distance provider. Sparked by the telecom boom, however, WorldCom soon became a darling of Wall Street, and its stock price soared. Now working for a wildly successful company, Vinson rounded out her life by reading legal thrillers and watching her twelve-year-old daughter play soccer.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s00_p02">Her moment of truth came in mid-2000, when company executives learned that profits had plummeted. They asked Vinson to make some accounting adjustments to boost income by $828 million. She knew that the scheme was unethical (at the very least) but gave in and made the adjustments. Almost immediately, she felt guilty and told her boss that she was quitting. When news of her decision came to the attention of CEO Bernard Ebbers and CFO Scott Sullivan, they hastened to assure Vinson that she’d never be asked to cook any more books. Sullivan explained it this way: “We have planes in the air. Let’s get the planes landed. Once they’ve landed, if you still want to leave, then leave. But not while the planes are in the air.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_002">Susan Pullman, “How Following Orders Can Harm Your Career,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, June 23, 2003, <em class="emphasis">CareerJournal.com</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3010537/c_3036075">http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3010537/c_3036075</a> (accessed January 22, 2012).</span> Besides, she’d done nothing illegal, and if anyone asked, he’d take full responsibility. So Vinson decided to stay. After all, Sullivan was one of the top CFOs in the country; at age thirty-seven, he was already making $19 million a year.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_003">Amanda Ripley, “The Night Detective,” <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, December 22, 2002, <a class="link" href="http://www.time.com/time/personoftheyear/2002">http://www.time.com/time/personoftheyear/2002</a> (accessed April 24, 2006).</span> Who was she to question his judgment?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_004">Jeff Clabaugh, “WorldCom’s Betty Vinson Gets 5 Months in Jail,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Business Journal</em>, August 5, 2005, Albuquerque Bizjournals.com, <a class="link" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2005/08/01/daily51.html">http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2005/08/01/daily51.html</a> (accessed January 22, 2012).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s00_p03">Six months later, Ebbers and Sullivan needed another adjustment—this time for $771 million. This scheme was even more unethical than the first: It entailed forging dates to hide the adjustment. Pretty soon, Vinson was making adjustments on a quarterly basis—first for $560 million, then for $743 million, and yet again for $941 million. Eventually, Vinson had juggled almost $4 billion, and before long, the stress started to get to her: She had trouble sleeping, lost weight, looked terrible, and withdrew from people at work. But when she got a promotion and a $30,000 raise, she decided to hang in.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s00_p04">By spring 2002, however, it was obvious that adjusting the books was business as usual at WorldCom. Vinson finally decided that it was time to move on, but, unfortunately, an internal auditor had already put two and two together and blown the whistle. The Securities and Exchange Commission charged WorldCom with fraud amounting to $11 billion—the largest in U.S. history. Seeing herself as a valuable witness, Vinson was eager to tell what she knew. The government, however, regarded her as more than a mere witness. When she was named a co-conspirator, she agreed to cooperate fully and pleaded guilty to criminal conspiracy and securities fraud. And that’s why Betty Vinson will spend five months in jail. But she won’t be the only one doing time: Scott Sullivan—who claims he’s innocent—will be in jail for five years, and Bernie Ebbers—who swears he’s innocent also—will be locked up for twenty-five years.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_005">Scott Reeves, “Lies, Damned Lies and Scott Sullivan,” Forbes.com, February 17, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://www.forbes.com/2005/02/17/cx_sr_0217ebbers.html">http://www.forbes.com/2005/02/17/cx_sr_0217ebbers.html</a> (accessed January 22, 2012); David A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s00_p05">So where did Betty Vinson, mild-mannered midlevel executive and mother, go wrong? How did she manage to get involved in a scheme that not only bilked investors out of billions but also cost seventeen thousand people their jobs?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_006">Susan Pullman, “How Following Orders Can Harm Your Career,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, June 23, 2003, <em class="emphasis">CareerJournal.com</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3010537/c_3036075">http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3010537/c_3036075</a> (accessed January 22, 2012).</span> Ultimately, of course, we can only guess. Maybe she couldn’t say no to her bosses; maybe she believed that they’d take full responsibility for her accounting “adjustments.” Possibly she was afraid of losing her job. Perhaps she didn’t fully understand the ramifications of what she was doing.

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s01_p01">The WorldCom situation is not an isolated incident. The boom years of the 1990s were followed by revelations of massive corporate corruption, including criminal schemes at companies such as Enron, Adelphia, and Tyco. In fall 2001, executives at Enron, an energy supplier, admitted to accounting practices concocted to overstate the company’s income over a period of four years. In the wake of the company’s collapse, stock prices plummeted from $90 to $1 a share, inflicting massive financial losses on the investment community. Thousands of employees lost not only their jobs but their retirement funds, as well.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_008">Daniel Kadlec, “Enron: Who’s Accountable?” <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, January 21, 2002, 31.</span> Before the Enron story was off the front pages, officials at Adelphia, the nation’s sixth-largest cable company, disclosed that founder and CEO John Rigas had treated the publicly owned firm as a personal piggy bank, siphoning off billions of dollars to support his family’s extravagant lifestyle and bankrupting the company in the process.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_009">David Lieberman, “Prosecutors Wrap Up $3.2B Adelphia Case,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, June 25, 2004, <a class="link" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/telecom/2004-06-25-adelphia_x.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/telecom/2004-06-25-adelphia_x.htm</a> (accessed January 22, 2012).</span> Likewise, CEO Dennis Koslowzki of conglomerate Tyco International was apparently confused about what was his and what belonged to the company. Besides treating himself to a $30 million estate in Florida and a $7 million Park Avenue apartment, Koslowzki indulged in a taste for expensive office accessories—such as a $15,000 umbrella stand, a $17,000 traveling toilette box, and a $2,200 wastebasket—that eventually drained $600 million from company coffers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_010">“Tyco Wants Its Money Back,” <em class="emphasis">CNNMoney</em>, September 17, 2002, <a class="link" href="http://money.cnn.com/2002/09/17/news/companies/tyco/index.htm">http://money.cnn.com/2002/09/17/news/companies/tyco/index.htm</a> (accessed January 22, 2012).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-5300-20111107-144704-131695">As crooked as these CEOs were, Bernie Madoff, founder of Bernard L.

His wrongdoings won him a spot at the top of  <em class="emphasis">Time Magazine</em>’s Top 10 Crooked CEOs. According to the SEC charges, Madoff convinced investors to give him large sums of money. In return, he gave them an impressive 8 percent to  12 percent return a year. But Madoff never really invested their money.  Instead, he kept it for himself. He got funds to pay the first investors  their return (or their money back if they asked for it) by bringing in  new investors. Everything was going smoothly until the fall of 2008,  when the stock market plummeted and many of his investors asked for  their money back. As he no longer had their money, the game was over and  he had to admit that the whole thing was just one big lie. Thousands of investors, including many of his wealthy friends, not-so-rich retirees who trusted him with their life savings, and charitable foundations, were financially ruined. All those harmed by Madoff either directly or indirectly were pleased when he was sentenced to jail for one-hundred and fifty years.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s01_p02">Are these cases merely aberrations? A <em class="emphasis">Time</em>/CNN poll conducted in the midst of all these revelations found that 72 percent of those surveyed don’t think so. They believe that breach of investor and employee trust represents an ongoing, long-standing pattern of deceptive behavior by officials at a large number of companies.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_012">Nancy Gibbs et al., “Summer of Mistrust,” <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, July 22, 2002, 20.</span> If they’re right, then a lot of questions need to be answered. Why do such incidents happen (and with such apparent regularity)? Who are the usual suspects? How long until the next corporate bankruptcy record is set? What action can be taken—by individuals, organizations, and the government—to discourage such behavior?</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Idea of Business Ethics</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s01_s01_p01">It’s in the best interest of a company to operate ethically. Trustworthy companies are better at attracting and keeping customers, talented employees, and capital. Those tainted by questionable ethics suffer from dwindling customer bases, employee turnover, and investor mistrust.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s01_s01_p02">Let’s begin this section by addressing one of the questions that we posed previously: What can individuals, organizations, and government agencies do to foster an environment of ethical and socially responsible behavior in business? First, of course, we need to define two terms: <em class="emphasis">business ethics</em> and <em class="emphasis">social responsibility</em>. They’re often used interchangeably, but they don’t mean the same thing.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch02_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">What Is Ethics?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s01_s01_s01_p01">You probably already know what it means to be <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ethical</a><span class="glossdef">Ability and willingness to distinguish right from wrong and when you’re practicing one or the other.</span></span>: to know right from wrong and to know when you’re practicing one instead of the other. At the risk of oversimplifying, then, we can say that <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">business ethics</a><span class="glossdef">Application of ethical behavior in a business context.</span></span> is the application of ethical behavior in a business context. Acting ethically in business means more than simply obeying applicable laws and regulations: It also means being honest, doing no harm to others, competing fairly, and declining to put your own interests above those of your company, its owners, and its workers. If you’re in business you obviously need a strong sense of what’s right and what’s wrong (not always an easy task). You need the personal conviction to <em class="emphasis">do</em> what’s right, even if it means doing something that’s difficult or personally disadvantageous.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How Can You Recognize an Ethical Organization?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s01_s03_p01">One goal of anyone engaged in business should be to foster ethical behavior in the organizational environment. How do we know when an organization is behaving ethically? Most lists of ethical organizational activities include the following criteria:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch02_s01_s03_l01">
            <li>Treating employees, customers, investors, and the public fairly</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s01_s03_p02">Whether you work for a business or for a nonprofit organization, you probably have a sense of whether your employer is ethical or unethical. Employees at companies that consistently make <em class="emphasis">Business Ethics</em> magazine’s list of the “100 Best Corporate Citizens” regard the items on the previous list as business as usual in the workplace. Companies that routinely win good-citizenship awards include Procter &amp; Gamble, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Avon Products, Cisco Systems, and Merck.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111111-093529-160882">“100 Best Corporate Citizens for 2010,” <em class="emphasis">Corporate Responsibility Magazine</em>, no. 11, Spring 2011, <a class="link" href="http://thecro.com/content/100-best-corporate-citizens">http://thecro.com/content/100-best-corporate-citizens</a> (accessed September 5, 2011).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s01_s03_p03">By contrast, employees with the following attitudes tend to suspect that their employers aren’t as ethical as they should be:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch02_s01_s03_l02">
            <li>They consistently feel uneasy about the work they do.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s01_s03_p04">In the early 1990s, many workers in Sears automotive service centers shared suspicions about certain policies, including the ways in which they were supposed to deal with customers. In particular, they felt uncomfortable with a new compensation plan that rewarded them for selling alignments, brake jobs, shock absorbers, and other parts and services. Those who met quotas got bonuses; those who didn’t were often fired. The results shouldn’t be surprising: In their zeal to meet quotas and keep their jobs, some employees misled customers into believing they needed parts and services when, in fact, they were not needed. Before long, Sears was flooded with complaints from customers—as were law-enforcement officials—in more than forty states. Sears denied any intent to deceive customers but was forced not only to eliminate sales commissions but also to pay out $60 million in refunds.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Study Ethics?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s01_s04_p01">Ideally, prison terms, heavy fines, and civil suits should put a damper on corporate misconduct, but, unfortunately, many experts suspect that this assumption may be a bit optimistic. Whatever the condition of the ethical environment in the near future, one thing seems clear: The next generation entering business—which includes most of you—will find a world much different than the one that waited for the previous generation. Recent history tells us in no uncertain terms that today’s business students, many of whom are tomorrow’s business leaders, need a much sharper understanding of the difference between what is and isn’t ethically acceptable. As a business student, one of your key tasks is learning how to recognize and deal with the ethical challenges that will confront you.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s01_s04_p02">Moreover, knowing right from wrong will make you more marketable as a job candidate. Asked what he looked for in a new hire, Warren Buffet, the world’s most successful investor, replied: “I look for three things. The first is personal integrity, the second is intelligence, and the third is a high energy level.” He paused and then added: “But if you don’t have the first, the second two don’t matter.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_016">Quoted by Adrian Gostick and Dana Telford, <em class="emphasis">The Integrity Advantage</em> (Salt Lake City: Gibbs Smith, 2003), 3–4.</span></p>

She undoubtedly knew what the right behavior was, but the bottom line is that she didn’t <em class="emphasis">do</em> it. How can you make sure that you do the right thing in the business world? How should you respond to the kinds of challenges that you’ll be facing? Because your actions in the business world will be strongly influenced by your moral character, let’s begin by assessing your current moral condition. Which of the following best applies to you (select one)?</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch02_s02_l02">

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s02_p02">Now that you’ve placed yourself in one of these categories, here are some general observations. Few people put themselves below the second category. Most of us are ethical most of the time, and most people assign themselves to category number two—“I’m <em class="emphasis">mostly</em> ethical.” Why don’t more people claim that they’re <em class="emphasis">always</em> ethical? Apparently, most people realize that being ethical all the time takes a great deal of moral energy. If you placed yourself in category number two, ask yourself this question: How can I change my behavior so that I can move up a notch? The answer to this question may be simple. Just ask yourself an easier question: How would I like to be treated in a given situation?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_017">John C. Maxwell, <em class="emphasis">There’s No Such Thing as “Business Ethics”: There’s Only One Rule for Making Decisions</em> (New York: Warner Books, 2003), 19–21.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s02_p03">Unfortunately, practicing this philosophy might be easier in your personal life than in the business world. Ethical challenges arise in business because business organizations, especially large ones, have multiple stakeholders and because stakeholders make conflicting demands. Making decisions that affect multiple stakeholders isn’t easy even for seasoned managers; and for new entrants to the business world, the task can be extremely daunting. Many managers need years of experience in an organization before they feel comfortable making decisions that affect various stakeholders. You can, however, get a head start in learning how to make ethical decisions by looking at two types of challenges that you’ll encounter in the business world: <em class="emphasis">ethical dilemmas</em> and <em class="emphasis">ethical decisions</em>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Addressing Ethical Dilemmas</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s02_s01_p01">An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ethical dilemma</a><span class="glossdef">Morally problematic situation.</span></span> is a morally problematic situation: You have to pick between two or more acceptable but often opposing alternatives that are important to different groups. Experts often frame this type of situation as a “right-versus-right” decision. It’s the sort of decision that Johnson &amp; Johnson (known as J&amp;J) CEO James Burke had to make in 1982.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_018">See Tamara Kaplan, “The Tylenol Crisis: How Effective Public Relations Saved Johnson &amp; Johnson,” <a class="link" href="http://www.aerobiologicalengineering.com/wxk116/TylenolMurders/crisis.html">http://www.aerobiologicalengineering.com/wxk116/TylenolMurders/crisis.html</a> (accessed January 22, 2012).</span> On September 30, twelve-year-old Mary Kellerman of Chicago died after her parents gave her Extra-Strength Tylenol. That same morning, twenty-seven-year-old Adam Janus, also of Chicago, died after taking Tylenol for minor chest pain. That night, when family members came to console his parents, Adam’s brother and his wife took Tylenol from the same bottle and died within forty-eight hours. Over the next two weeks, four more people in Chicago died after taking Tylenol. The actual connection between Tylenol and the series of deaths wasn’t made until an off-duty fireman realized from news reports that every victim had taken Tylenol. As consumers panicked, J&amp;J pulled Tylenol off Chicago-area retail shelves. Researchers discovered Tylenol capsules containing large amounts of deadly cyanide. Because the poisoned bottles came from batches originating at different J&amp;J plants, investigators determined that the tampering had occurred after the product had been shipped.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s02_s01_p02">So J&amp;J wasn’t at fault. But CEO Burke was still faced with an extremely serious dilemma: Was it possible to respond to the tampering cases without destroying the reputation of a highly profitable brand? Burke had two options:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch02_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>He could recall only the lots of Extra-Strength Tylenol that were found to be tainted with cyanide. This was the path followed by Perrier executives in 1991 when they discovered that cases of bottled water had been poisoned with benzine. This option favored J&amp;J financially but possibly put more people at risk.</li>
            <li>Burke could order a nationwide recall—of all bottles of Extra-Strength Tylenol. This option would reverse the priority of the stakeholders, putting the safety of the public above stakeholders' financial interests.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s02_s01_p03">Burke opted to recall all 31 million bottles of Extra-Strength Tylenol on the market. The cost to J&amp;J was $100 million, but public reaction was quite positive. Less than six weeks after the crisis began, Tylenol capsules were reintroduced in new tamper-resistant bottles, and by responding quickly and appropriately, J&amp;J was eventually able to restore the Tylenol brand to its previous market position. When Burke was applauded for moral courage, he replied that he’d simply adhered to the long-standing J&amp;J credo that put the interests of customers above those of other stakeholders. His only regret was that the tamperer was never caught.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_019">Yaakov Weber, “CEO Saves Company’s Reputation, Products,” <em class="emphasis">New Sunday Times</em>, June 13, 1999, <a class="link" href="http://adtimes.nstp.com.my/jobstory/jun13.htm">http://adtimes.nstp.com.my/jobstory/jun13.htm</a> (accessed April 24, 2006).</span></p>

She also told the committee she was retiring. This had to be a major disappointment for her. Before J&amp;J started falling apart, she was a contender to take over as CEO when Weldon retired. But, as is true with Weldon, don’t shed too many tears for her. Goggins departed from J&amp;J a wealthy woman after cashing in one-third of her shares of company stock for $3 million.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_077">“J&amp;J’s Colleen Goggins Sells Nearly $3M in Stock,” Citibizlist, September 14, 2010 (accessed August 16, 2011).</span></p>

Others, unfortunately, are more complicated, but it will help to think of our five-question test as a set of signals that will warn you that you’re facing a particularly tough decision—that you should think carefully about it and perhaps consult someone else. The situation is like approaching a traffic light. Red and green lights are easy; you know what they mean and exactly what to do. Yellow lights are trickier.

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_p01">Make no mistake about it: When you enter the business world, you’ll find yourself in situations in which you’ll have to choose the appropriate behavior. How, for example, would you answer questions like the following?</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_l02">
        <li>Is it OK to accept a pair of sports tickets from a supplier?</li>

        <li>What do I do if I discover that a coworker is committing fraud?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_p02">Obviously, the types of situations are numerous and varied. Fortunately, we can break them down into a few basic categories: <em class="emphasis">bribes</em>, <em class="emphasis">conflicts of interest</em>, <em class="emphasis">conflicts of loyalty</em>, <em class="emphasis">issues of honesty and integrity</em>, and <em class="emphasis">whistle-blowing</em>. Let’s look a little more closely at each of these categories.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch02_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Bribes versus Gifts</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s01_p01">It’s not uncommon in business to give and receive small gifts of appreciation. But when is a gift unacceptable? When is it really a bribe? If it’s OK to give a bottle of wine to a corporate client during the holidays, is it OK to give a case of wine? If your company is trying to get a big contract, is it appropriate to send a gift to the key decision maker? If it’s all right to invite a business acquaintance to dinner or to a ball game, is it also all right to offer the same person a fully paid weekend getaway?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s01_p02">There’s often a fine line between a gift and a bribe. The questions that we’ve just asked, however, may help in drawing it, because they raise key issues in determining how a gesture should be interpreted: the cost of the item, the timing of the gift, the type of gift, and the connection between the giver and the receiver. If you’re on the receiving end, it’s a good idea to refuse any item that’s overly generous or given for the purpose of influencing a decision. But because accepting even small gifts may violate company rules, the best advice is to check on company policy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s01_p03">JCPenney’s “Statement of Business Ethics,” for instance, states that employees can’t accept any cash gifts or any noncash gifts except those that have a value below $50 and that are generally used by the giver for promotional purposes. Employees can attend paid-for business functions, but other forms of entertainment, such as sports events and golf outings, can be accepted only if it’s practical for the Penney’s employee to reciprocate. Trips of several days can’t be accepted under any circumstances.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_021">JCPenney Co., “Statement of Business Ethics for Associates and Officers: The ‘Spirit’ of This Statement,” <a class="link" href="http://ir.jcpenney.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=70528&amp;p=irol-govconduct">http://ir.jcpenney.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=70528&amp;p=irol-govconduct</a> (accessed April 24, 2006).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Conflicts of Interest</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Conflicts of interest</a><span class="glossdef">Situation in which an individual must choose between the promotion of personal interests and the interests of others.</span></span> occur when individuals must choose between taking actions that promote their personal interests over the interests of others or taking actions that don’t. A conflict can exist, for example, when an employee’s own interests interfere with, or have the potential to interfere with, the best interests of the company’s stakeholders (management, customers, owners). Let’s say that you work for a company with a contract to cater events at your college and that your uncle owns a local bakery. Obviously, this situation could create a conflict of interest (or at least give the appearance of one—which, by the way, is a problem in itself). When you’re called on to furnish desserts for a luncheon, you might be tempted to throw some business your uncle’s way even if it’s not in the best interest of the catering company that you work for.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s02_p02">What should you do? You should probably disclose the connection to your boss, who can then arrange things so that your personal interests don’t conflict with the company’s. You may, for example, agree that if you’re assigned to order products like those that your uncle makes, you’re obligated to find another supplier. Or your boss may make sure that someone else orders bakery products.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s02_p03">The same principle holds that an employee shouldn’t use private information about an employer for personal financial benefit. Say that you learn from a coworker at your pharmaceutical company that one of its most profitable drugs will be pulled off the market because of dangerous side effects. The recall will severely hurt the company’s financial performance and cause its stock price to plummet. Before the news becomes public, you sell all the stock you own in the company. What you’ve done isn’t merely unethical: It’s called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">insider trading</a><span class="glossdef">Practice of buying or selling of securities using important information about the company before it’s made public.</span></span>, it’s illegal, and you could go to jail for it.</p>

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch02_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Conflicts of Loyalty</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s03_p01">Sometimes you find yourself in a bind between being loyal either to your employer or to a friend or family member. Perhaps you just learned that a coworker, a friend of yours, is about to be downsized out of his job. You also happen to know that he and his wife are getting ready to make a deposit on a house near the company headquarters. From a work standpoint, you know that you shouldn’t divulge the information. From a friendship standpoint, though, you feel it’s your duty to tell your friend. Wouldn’t he tell you if the situation were reversed? So what do you do? As tempting as it is to be loyal to your friend, you shouldn’t. As an employee, your primary responsibility is to your employer. You might be able to soften your dilemma by convincing a manager with the appropriate authority to tell your friend the bad news before he puts down his deposit.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Issues of Honesty and Integrity</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04_p01">Master investor Warren Buffet once told a group of business students the following:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04_p02">“I cannot tell you that honesty is the best policy. I can’t tell you that if you behave with perfect honesty and integrity somebody somewhere won’t behave the other way and make more money. But honesty is a good policy. You’ll do fine, you’ll sleep well at night and you’ll feel good about the example you are setting for your coworkers and the other people who care about you.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_022">Quoted by Adrian Gostick and Dana Telford, <em class="emphasis">The Integrity Advantage</em> (Salt Lake City: Gibbs Smith, 2003), 103.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04_p03">If you work for a company that settles for its employees’ merely obeying the law and following a few internal regulations, you might think about moving on. If you’re being asked to deceive customers about the quality or value of your product, you’re in an ethically unhealthy environment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04_p04">Think about this story:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04_bl02">
            <p class="para editable" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04_p05">“A chef put two frogs in a pot of warm soup water. The first frog smelled the onions, recognized the danger, and immediately jumped out. The second frog hesitated: The water felt good, and he decided to stay and relax for a minute. After all, he could always jump out when things got too hot (so to speak). As the water got hotter, however, the frog adapted to it, hardly noticing the change. Before long, of course, he was the main ingredient in frog-leg soup.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_023">Adapted from Adrian Gostick and Dana Telford, <em class="emphasis">The Integrity Advantage</em> (Salt Lake City: Gibbs Smith, 2003), 16.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04_p06">So, what’s the moral of the story? Don’t sit around in an ethically toxic environment and lose your integrity a little at a time; get out before the water gets too hot and your options have evaporated.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s04_p07">Fortunately, a few rules of thumb can guide you. We’ve summed them up in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch02_s03_s04_f01">Figure 2.4 "How to Maintain Honesty and Integrity"</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Whistle-Blowing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s05_p01">As we’ve seen, the misdeeds of Betty Vinson and her accomplices at WorldCom didn’t go undetected. They caught the eye of Cynthia Cooper, the company’s director of internal auditing. Cooper, of course, could have looked the other way, but instead she summoned up the courage to be a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">whistle-blower</a><span class="glossdef">Individual who exposes illegal or unethical behavior in an organization.</span></span>—an individual who exposes illegal or unethical behavior in an organization. Like Vinson, Cooper had majored in accounting at Mississippi State and was a hard-working, dedicated employee. Unlike Vinson, however, she refused to be bullied by her boss, CFO Scott Sullivan. In fact, she had tried to tell not only Sullivan but also auditors from the huge Arthur Andersen accounting firm that there was a problem with WorldCom’s books. The auditors dismissed her warnings, and when Sullivan angrily told her to drop the matter, she started cleaning out her office. But she didn’t relent. She and her team worked late each night, conducting an extensive, secret investigation. Two months later, Cooper had evidence to take to Sullivan, who told her once again to back off. Again, however, she stood up to him, and though she regretted the consequences for her WorldCom coworkers, she reported the scheme to the company’s board of directors. Within days, Sullivan was fired and the largest accounting fraud in history became public.</p>
        <div class="figure medium editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s05_f01">

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s05_p02">As a result of Cooper’s actions, executives came clean about the company’s financial situation. The conspiracy of fraud was brought to an end, and though public disclosure of WorldCom’s problems resulted in massive stock-price declines and employee layoffs, investor and employee losses would have been greater without Cooper’s intervention.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s05_p03">Even though Cooper did the right thing, the experience wasn’t exactly gratifying. A lot of people applauded her action, but many coworkers shunned her; some even blamed <em class="emphasis">her</em> for the company’s troubles. She’s never been thanked by any senior executive at WorldCom. Five months after the fraud went public, new CEO Michael Capellas assembled what was left of the demoralized workforce to give them a pep talk on the company’s future. The senior management team mounted the stage and led the audience in a rousing rendition of “If you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands!” Cynthia Cooper wasn’t invited.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_024">See Adrian Gostick and Dana Telford, <em class="emphasis">The Integrity Advantage</em> (Salt Lake City: Gibbs Smith, 2003), 13.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s05_p04">Whistle-blowing often means career suicide. A survey of two hundred whistle-blowers conducted by the National Whistleblower Center found that half of them had been fired for blowing the whistle.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_025">National Whistleblower Center, “Labor Day Report: The National Status of Whistleblower Protection on Labor Day, 2002,” <a class="link" href="http://www.whistleblowers.org/labordayreport.htm">http://www.whistleblowers.org/labordayreport.htm</a> (accessed April 24, 2006).</span> Even those who get to keep their jobs experience painful repercussions. As long as they stay, some people will treat them (as one whistle-blower puts it) “like skunks at a picnic”; if they leave, they’re frequently blackballed in the industry.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_026">Paula Dwyer et al., “Year of the Whistleblower,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek Online</em>, December 16, 2002, <a class="link" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_50/b3812094.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_50/b3812094.htm</a> (accessed January 22, 2012).</span> On a positive note, there’s the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which protects whistle-blowers under federal law.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s05_p05">For her own part, Cynthia Cooper doesn’t regret what she did.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Refusing to Rationalize</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s03_s06_p01">Despite all the good arguments in favor of doing the right thing, why do many reasonable people act unethically (at least at times)?

            <li>
<em class="emphasis">My behavior isn’t really illegal or immoral</em>. Rationalizers try to convince themselves that an action is OK if it isn’t downright illegal or blatantly immoral. They tend to operate in a gray area where there’s no clear evidence that the action is wrong.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">My action is in everyone’s best interests</em>. Some rationalizers tell themselves: “I know I lied to make the deal, but it’ll bring in a lot of business and pay a lot of bills.” They convince themselves that they’re expected to act in a certain way, forgetting the classic parental parable about jumping off a cliff just because your friends are.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_030">Adrian Gostick and Dana Telford, <em class="emphasis">The Integrity Advantage</em> (Salt Lake City: Gibbs Smith, 2003), 12.</span>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s04_p01">Ethics is more than a matter of individual behavior; it’s also about organizational behavior. Employees’ actions aren’t based solely on personal values alone: They’re influenced by other members of the organization, from top managers and supervisors to coworkers and subordinates. So how can ethical companies be created and sustained? In this section, we’ll examine some of the most reasonable answers to this question.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch02_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Ethical Leadership</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s04_s01_p01">Organizations have unique <em class="emphasis">cultures</em>—ways of doing things that evolve through shared values and beliefs. An organization’s culture is strongly influenced by senior executives, who tell members of the organization what’s considered acceptable behavior and what happens if it’s violated. In theory, the tone set at the top of the organization promotes ethical behavior, but sometimes (as at Enron) it doesn’t.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s04_s01_p02">Before its sudden demise, Enron fostered a growth-at-any-cost culture that was defined by the company’s top executives. Said one employee, “It was all about taking profits now and worrying about the details later. The Enron system was just ripe for corruption.” Coupled with the relentless pressure to generate revenue—or at least to look as if you were generating it—was a climate that discouraged employees from questioning the means by which they were supposed to do it. There may have been chances for people to speak up, but no one did. “I don’t think anyone started out with a plan to defraud the company,” reflects another ex-employee. “Everything at Enron seemed to start out right, but somewhere something slipped. People’s mentality switched from focusing on the future good of the company to ‘let’s just do it today.’”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_031">See especially Tom Fowler, “The Pride and the Fall of Enron,” <em class="emphasis">Houston Chronicle</em>, October 20, 2002, <a class="link" href="http://www.chron.com/business/enron/article/Enron-s-corporate-tumble-was-a-long-time-coming-2083723.php">http://www.chron.com/business/enron/article/Enron-s-corporate-tumble-was-a-long-time-coming-2083723.php</a> (accessed April 24, 2006).</span></p>

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch02_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Exercising Ethical Leadership</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s04_s02_p01">Leaders should keep in constant touch with subordinates about ethical policies and expectations. They should be available to help employees identify and solve ethical problems, and should encourage them to come forward with concerns. They’re responsible for minimizing opportunities for wrongdoing and for exerting the controls needed to enforce company policies. They should also think of themselves as role models. Subordinates look to their supervisors to communicate policies and practices regarding ethical behavior, and as a rule, actions speak more loudly than words: If managers behave ethically, subordinates will probably do the same.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s04_s02_p02">This is exactly the message that senior management at Martin Marietta (now a part of Lockheed Martin) sent to members of their organization. A leading producer of construction components, the company at the time was engaged in a tough competitive battle over a major contract. Because both Martin Marietta and its main competitor were qualified to do the work, the job would go to the lower bid. A few days before bids were due, a package arrived at Martin Marietta containing a copy of the competitor’s bid sheet (probably from a disgruntled employee trying to sabotage his or her employer’s efforts). The bid price was lower than Martin Marietta’s. In a display of ethical backbone, executives immediately turned the envelope over to the government and informed the competitor. No, they didn’t change their own bid in the meantime, and, no, they didn’t get the job. All they got was an opportunity to send a clear message to the entire organization.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_032">Episode recounted by Norm Augustine, “Business Ethics in the 21st Century” (speech, Ethics Resource Center), <a class="link" href="http://www.ethics.org/resources/speech_detail.cfm?ID=848">http://www.ethics.org/resources/speech_detail.cfm?ID=848</a> (accessed April 24, 2006).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s04_s02_p03">By the same token, leaders must be willing to hold subordinates accountable for their conduct and to take appropriate action. The response to unethical behavior should be prompt and decisive. One CEO of a large company discovered that some of his employees were “dumpster diving” in the trash outside a competitor’s offices (which is to say, they were sifting around for information that would give them a competitive advantage). The manager running the espionage operation was a personal friend of the CEO’s, but he was immediately fired, as were his “operatives.” The CEO then informed his competitor about the venture and returned all the materials that had been gathered. Like the top managers at Martin Marietta, this executive sent a clear message to people in his organization: namely, that deviations from accepted behavior would not be tolerated.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_033">Norm Augustine, “Business Ethics in the 21st Century” (speech, Ethics Resource Center), <a class="link" href="http://www.ethics.org/resources/speech_detail.cfm?ID=848">http://www.ethics.org/resources/speech_detail.cfm?ID=848</a> (accessed April 24, 2006).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s04_s02_p04">It’s always possible to send the wrong message. In August 2004, newspapers around the country carried a wire-service story titled “Convicted CEO Getting $2.5 Million Salary While He Serves Time.” Interested readers found that the board of directors of Fog Cutter Capital Group had agreed to pay CEO Andrew Wiederhorn (and give him a bonus) while he served an eighteen-month federal-prison term for bribery, filing false tax returns, and financially ruining his previous employer (from which he’d also borrowed $160 million). According to the board, they couldn’t afford to lose a man of Wiederhorn’s ability. The entire episode ended up on TheStreet.com’s list of “The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_034">William McCall, “CEO Will Get Salary, Bonus in Prison,” <em class="emphasis">CorpWatch</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.corpwatch.org/print_article.php?&amp;id=11476">http://www.corpwatch.org/print_article.php?&amp;id=11476</a> (accessed April 24, 2006).</span></p>

What motivates companies to be “socially responsible” to their various stakeholders? We hope it’s because they want to do the right thing, and for many companies, “doing the right thing” is a key motivator. The fact is, it’s often hard to figure out what the “right thing” is: What’s “right” for one group of stakeholders isn’t necessarily just as “right” for another. One thing, however, is certain: Companies today are held to higher standards than ever before. Consumers and other groups consider not only the quality and price of a company’s products but also its character. If too many groups see a company as a poor corporate citizen, it will have a harder time attracting qualified employees, finding investors, and selling its products. Good corporate citizens, by contrast, are more successful in all these areas.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s05_p02"><a class="xref" href="#collins-ch02_s05_f01">Figure 2.6 "The Corporate Citizen"</a> presents a model of corporate responsibility based on a company’s relationships with its <em class="emphasis">stakeholders</em>.

Here, owners are the stakeholders who invest risk capital in the firm in expectation of a financial return. Other stakeholders include employees, suppliers, and the communities in which the firm does business. Proponents of this model hold that customers, who provide the firm with revenue, have a special claim on managers’ attention. The arrows indicate the two-way nature of corporation-stakeholder relationships: All stakeholders have some claim on the firm’s resources and returns, and it’s management’s job to make decisions that balance these claims.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_036">See David P.

In return, the people who run a company have a responsibility to increase the value of owners’ investments through profitable operations. Managers also have a responsibility to provide owners (as well as other stakeholders having financial interests, such as creditors and suppliers) with accurate, reliable information about the performance of the business. Clearly, this is one of the areas in which WorldCom managers fell down on the job. Upper-level management purposely deceived shareholders by presenting them with fraudulent financial statements.</p>

This is a responsibility that was ignored by top executives at both Adelphia and Tyco, whose associates and families virtually looted company assets. To enforce managers’ fiduciary responsibilities for a firm’s financial statements and accounting records, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires CEOs and CFOs to attest to their accuracy. The law also imposes penalties on corporate officers, auditors, board members, and any others who commit fraud.</p>

The Department of Labor categorizes deaths caused by conditions like those at Johns Manville as “exposure to harmful substances or environments.” How prevalent is this condition as a cause of workplace deaths?

Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G), for example, considers the safety and health of its employees paramount and promotes the attitude that “Nothing we do is worth getting hurt for.” With nearly one hundred thousand employees worldwide, P&amp;G uses a measure of worker safety called “total incident rate per employee,” which records injuries resulting in loss of consciousness, time lost from work, medical transfer to another job, motion restriction, or medical treatment beyond first aid. The company attributes the low rate of such incidents—less than one incident per hundred employees—to a variety of programs to promote workplace safety.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_039">Procter &amp; Gamble, <em class="emphasis">2003 Sustainability Report</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.pg.com/content/pdf/01_about_pg/corporate_citizenship/sustainability/reports/sustainability_report_2003.pdf">http://www.pg.com/content/pdf/01_about_pg/corporate_citizenship/sustainability/reports/sustainability_report_2003.pdf</a> (accessed April 24, 2006).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s05_s01_s04_p01">What is <em class="emphasis">sexual harassment</em>? The law is quite precise:</p>

                <li>Sexual harassment occurs when an employee makes “unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature” to another employee who doesn’t welcome the advances.</li>
                <li>It’s also sexual harassment when “submission to or rejection of this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual’s employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_040">U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, “Facts about Sexual Harassment,” <a class="link" href="http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-sex.html">http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-sex.html</a> (accessed January 22, 2012).</span>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s05_s01_s04_p02">To prevent sexual harassment—or at least minimize its likelihood—a company should adopt a formal anti-harassment policy describing prohibited conduct, asserting its objections to the behavior, and detailing penalties for violating the policy.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111107-153340-188851">Joanna Grossman, “Sexual Harassment in the Workplace: Do Employers’ Efforts Truly Prevent Harassment, or Just Prevent Liability,” <em class="emphasis">Find Laws Legal Commentary, Writ</em>, <a class="link" href="http://writ.news.findlaw.com/grossman/20020507.html">http://writ.news.findlaw.com/grossman/20020507.html</a> (accessed January 22, 2012).</span> Employers also have an obligation to investigate harassment complaints. Failure to enforce anti-harassment policies can be very costly. In 1998, for example, Mitsubishi paid $34 million to more than three hundred fifty female employees of its Normal, Illinois, plant to settle a sexual harassment case supported by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The EEOC reprimanded the company for permitting an atmosphere of verbal and physical abuse against women, charging that female workers had been subjected to various forms of harassment, ranging from exposure to obscene graffiti and vulgar jokes to fondling and groping.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111107-153340-188914">Joanna Grossman, “Sexual Harassment in the Workplace: Do Employers’ Efforts Truly Prevent Harassment, or Just Prevent Liability,” <em class="emphasis">Find Laws Legal Commentary, Writ</em>, <a class="link" href="http://writ.news.findlaw.com/grossman/20020507.html">http://writ.news.findlaw.com/grossman/20020507.html</a> (accessed January 22, 2012).</span></p>

What has been the effect of the law after forty years? In 1963, women earned, on average, $0.589 for every $1 earned by men.

For one thing, the jobs typically held by women tend to pay less than those typically held by men. In addition, men often have better job opportunities. For example, a man newly hired at the same time as a woman will often get a higher-paying assignment at the entry level. Coupled with the fact that the same sort of discrimination applies when it comes to training and promotions, women are usually relegated to a lifetime of lower earnings.</p>

In helping to build more diverse workforces, such initiatives contribute to competitive advantage for two reasons: (1) People from diverse backgrounds bring new talents and fresh perspectives to an organization, typically enhancing creativity in the development of new products. (2) By reflecting more accurately the changing demographics of the marketplace, a diverse workforce improves a company’s ability to serve an ethnically diverse population.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s05_s01_s06_p01">At the very least, employers must obey laws governing minimum wage and overtime pay. A minimum wage is set by the federal government, though states can set their own rates. The current federal rate, for example, is $7.25, while the rate in the state of Washington is $8.67. When there’s a difference, the higher rate applies.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111107-153709-928431">U.S. Department of Labor, “Minimum Wage Laws in the States,” <a class="link" href="http://www.dol.gov/esa/minwage/america.htm">http://www.dol.gov/esa/minwage/america.htm</a> (accessed January 22, 2012).</span> By law, employers must also provide certain benefits—social security (which provides retirement benefits), unemployment insurance (which protects against loss of income in case of job loss), and workers’ compensation (which covers lost wages and medical costs in case of on-the-job injury). Most large companies pay most of their workers more than minimum wage and offer considerably broader benefits, including medical, dental, and vision care, as well as pension benefits.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s05_s02_p01">The purpose of any business is to satisfy customers, who reward businesses by buying their products. Sellers are also responsible—both ethically and legally—for treating customers fairly. The rights of consumers were first articulated by President John F. Kennedy in 1962 when he submitted to Congress a presidential message devoted to consumer issues.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_045">Henry A. Waxman, House of Representatives, “Remarks on Proposed Consumer Bill of Rights Day, Extension of Remarks,” March 15, 1993, <a class="link" href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r103:E15MR30-90">http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r103:E15MR30-90</a> (accessed April 24, 2006), 1–2.</span> Kennedy identified four consumer rights:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch02_s05_s02_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">The right to safe products</em>. A company should sell no product that it suspects of being unsafe for buyers. Thus, producers have an obligation to safety-test products before releasing them for public consumption. The automobile industry, for example, conducts extensive safety testing before introducing new models (though recalls remain common).</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">The right to be informed about a product</em>. Sellers should furnish consumers with the product information that they need to make an informed purchase decision. That’s why pillows have labels identifying the materials used to make them, for instance.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">The right to choose what to buy</em>. Consumers have a right to decide which products to purchase, and sellers should let them know what their options are. Pharmacists, for example, should tell patients when a prescription can be filled with a cheaper brand-name or generic drug. Telephone companies should explain alternative calling plans.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">The right to be heard</em>. Companies must tell customers how to contact them with complaints or concerns. They should also listen and respond.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s05_s02_p02">Companies share the responsibility for the legal and ethical treatment of consumers with several government agencies: the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforces consumer-protection laws; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which oversees the labeling of food products; and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which enforces laws protecting consumers from the risk of product-related injury.</p>

After all, the economic impact of business activities on local communities is substantial: They provide jobs, pay taxes, and support local education, health, and recreation programs. Both big and small businesses donate funds to community projects, encourage employees to volunteer their time, and donate equipment and products for a variety of activities. Larger companies can make greater financial contributions. Let’s start by taking a quick look at the philanthropic activities of a few U.S. corporations.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s06_p01">Today, virtually everyone agrees that companies must figure out how to produce products without compromising the right of future generations to meet their own needs. Clearly, protecting natural resources is the right thing to do, but it also has become a business necessity. Companies’ customers demand that they respect the environment. Let’s identify some key environmental issues and highlight the ways in which the business community has addressed them.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Land Pollution</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s06_s01_p01">The land we live on has been polluted by the dumping of waste and increasing reliance on agricultural chemicals. It’s pockmarked by landfills stuffed with the excess of a throwaway society. It’s been strip-mined and deforested, and urban sprawl on every continent has squeezed out wetlands and farmlands and destroyed wildlife habitats.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s06_s01_p02">Protecting the land from further damage, then, means disposing of waste in responsible ways (or, better yet, reducing the amount of waste). At both national and global levels, we must resolve the conflicts of interest between those who benefit economically from logging and mining and those who argue that protecting the environment is an urgent matter. Probably municipalities must step in to save open spaces and wetlands.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s06_s01_p03">Clothing manufacturer Patagonia has for years been in the forefront of efforts to protect the land.

Over time, we’ve managed to pollute the air with emissions of toxic gases and particles from factories, power plants, office buildings, cars, trucks, and even farms. In addition, our preferred method of deforestation is burning, a major source of air pollution. In some places, polluted air causes respiratory problems, particularly for the young and elderly. Factory emissions, including sulfur and other gases, mix with air and rain to produce <em class="emphasis">acid rain</em>, which returns to the earth to pollute forests, lakes, and streams. Perhaps most importantly, many experts—scientists, government officials, and businesspeople—are convinced that the heavy emission of carbon dioxide is altering the earth’s climate. Predictions of the effect of unchecked global warming include extreme weather conditions, flooding, oceanic disruptions, shifting storm patterns, droughts, reduced farm output, and even animal extinctions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_051">John Carey, “Global Warming,” <em class="emphasis">Business Week</em>, August 16, 2004, 64.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s06_s03_p01">Water makes up more than 70 percent of the earth’s surface, and it’s no secret that without it we wouldn’t be here. Unfortunately, that knowledge doesn’t stop us from polluting our oceans, rivers, and lakes and generally making our water unfit for use. Massive pollution occurs when such substances as oil and chemicals are dumped into bodies of water. The damage to the water, to the marine ecosystem, and to coastal wildlife from the accidental spilling of oil from supertankers and offshore drilling operations can be disastrous, and the cleanup can cost billions. Most contaminants, however, come from agricultural fertilizers, pesticides, wastewater, raw sewage, and silt that make their way into water systems over time.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_054">David Krantz and Brad Kifferstein, “Water Pollution and Society,” University of Michigan,<a class="link" href="http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/society/waterpollution.htm">http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/society/waterpollution.htm</a> (accessed April 24, 2006).</span> In some parts of the world—including certain areas in this country—water supplies are dwindling, partly because of diminishing rainfall and partly because of increased consumption.</p>

Companies are now held to stricter standards in the discharge of wastes into water treatment systems. In some places, particularly where water supplies are dangerously low, such as the Southwest, local governments have instituted conservation programs. In Arizona (which suffers a severe shortage), Home Depot works with governmental and nongovernmental agencies on a $1.8 million water-conservation campaign.

It was first published in 1971 by Random House, New York. The copyright was renewed in 1999.</span> It tells the story of how a business owners’ greed destroyed an ecosystem.  To manufacture and sell a product that the owner argued everyone needed, he cut down the trees in the forest, polluted the river, and fouled the air.  These actions destroyed the habitat for the bears that lived on the fruit that fell from the trees, the fish that swam in the streams and the birds that flew high up in the sky.  In 1971, these actions were not viewed negatively; business owners believed that the purpose of business was to make a profit without regard for the effect on the environment.</p>

Over the past ten to fifteen years, most of our large corporations have adopted measures that would have pleased environmentalists.  These initiatives fall under the umbrella called “sustainability.”  But what does sustainability mean?

The companies that do this earn reputations as good corporate citizens and enjoy certain benefits, such as the ability to keep satisfied customers, to attract capital, and to recruit and retain talented employees. But companies don’t become good corporate citizens overnight. Learning to identify and develop the capacity to address social concerns takes time and requires commitment. The task is arduous because so many different issues are important to so many different members of the public—issues ranging from the environment, to worker well-being (both at home and abroad), to fairness to customers, to respect for the community in which a company operates.</p>

McDonald’s reaction to the public outcry against the company’s menu items was defensive. For example, an owner of seven McDonald’s in midtown Manhattan said, “We offer healthy choices. It is up to individuals to set limits and to be informed.…McDonald’s discloses nutritional information about its foods in its restaurants.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_057">Chris Burritt, “McDonald’s Shrugs Off Obesity Case,” <em class="emphasis">Sina.com</em>, January 27, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://english.sina.com/business/1/2005/0127/19504.html">http://english.sina.com/business/1/2005/0127/19504.html</a> (accessed January 22, 2012).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s07_s02_s02_p01">In early 2004, the public’s attention was drawn to McDonald’s “super-size” options. Despite the fact that a super-sized meal delivered more than fifteen hundred calories, one in ten customers went for the upgrade. McDonald’s faced daily criticisms on its super-sizing campaign, from nutritionists, doctors, advocacy groups, and lawyers who held it up as a “grossly overweight” poster child for U.S. obesity concerns. And the company feared public criticism would escalate when the movie <em class="emphasis">Super Size Me</em> hit the theaters. The documentary tells the story of a young man who gained twenty-four pounds and wrecked his health by eating only McDonald’s food for a month. Even worse, one scene shows him getting sick in his car after trying to wolf down a super-size meal. So McDonald’s immediately moved from the defensive stage to the compliant stage and announced that it was eliminating its super-size option by the end of 2004. The move, though small, was in the right direction. It was touted by the company as a “menu simplification” process, but a spokesman did state, “It certainly is consistent with and on a parallel path with our ongoing commitment to a balanced lifestyle.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn02_058">Bruce Horovitz, “By Year’s End, Regular Size Will Have to Do,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, March 4, 2004, <a class="link" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2004-03-02-mcdonalds-supersize_x.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2004-03-02-mcdonalds-supersize_x.htm</a> (accessed January 22, 2012).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s07_s02_s03_p01">Criticism of McDonald’s continued as customers stayed away and its profits plummeted. The company searched for ways to win back customers and keep them long-term. To do this, it would have to come up with a healthier menu. Though McDonald’s had served salads for years, they weren’t very good. The company got serious about salads and introduced new, improved “premium salads,” complete with Newman’s Own salad dressing (a nice public relations touch, as all profits on the salad dressings are donated to charities). The company also improved the Happy Meal by letting kids substitute apple slices and low-fat milk for the usual fries and soda. Oprah Winfrey’s personal trainer was brought in to promote an adult version of the Happy Meal, called the GoActive meal, which includes a salad, a bottle of water, a book on nutrition, and a clip-on pedometer that measures the number of steps you take. The fat calories in Chicken McNuggets were lowered by coming out with all-white-meat McNuggets. And to appease those between-meal munchies, the company added a fruit-and-walnut salad to its menu. McDonald’s goal was to convince customers that it had turned a corner and would forever more offer healthy choices to both adults and children.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s07_s02_s04_p01">The new focus on healthy choices worked, and customers started returning. McDonald’s salads were well received and accounted for about 10 percent of sales. Overall, things improved financially for the company: Sales increased and profits rose. To complete the transition to a healthier image, McDonald’s came up with a new theme: helping adults and children live a balanced, active lifestyle. To go along with the theme, it launched a new active-life public-awareness campaign with the tagline “It’s what I eat and what I do…I’m lovin’ it.” McDonald’s demonstrated its concern for the health of its customers through permanent menu changes and an emphasis on the value of physical fitness. Even Ronald McDonald, the company’s mascot, helped out by shooting hoops with NBA basketball star Yao Ming. The company launched a program called GoActive to help people find fun ways to build physical activity and fitness into their daily lives.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch02_s07_s02_s05_p01">McDonald’s hasn’t advanced to the final stage yet; it hasn’t enlisted the cooperation of other fast-food companies in encouraging children and adults to eat healthier foods. It’s difficult to predict whether it will assume this role in the future, or even whether the company will stick with its healthier lifestyle theme. Indeed, it’s hard to reconcile McDonald’s commitment to helping people eat healthier with a promotion in the Chicago area that gave a free forty-two-ounce “super-size” soda to anyone buying a Big Mac and fries. Given that a Big Mac and medium fries deliver 910 calories, it’s hard to justify encouraging customers to pile on an additional 410 calories for a big drink (at least, it’s hard to justify this if you’re promoting yourself as a company helping people eat better).<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111107-160023-205434">Eric Herman, “McDonald’s Giant Drinks Return,” <em class="emphasis">Chicago Sun-Times</em>, June 17, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1424786/posts">http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1424786/posts</a> (accessed January 22, 2012).</span></p>

                    <li>

                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Compliant</em>. During this stage, companies do only what they have to do to satisfy their critics, protect brands or reputations, and reduce the risk of litigation.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Managerial</em>. When it’s clear that the problem won’t go away, companies take responsibility and look for long-term solutions.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Strategic</em>. At this point, they may start to reap the benefits of acting responsibly. Responding to public needs gives them a competitive edge and enhances long-term success.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Civil</em>. Ultimately, companies recognize the importance of getting other companies to follow their lead. They enlist the cooperation of other companies in supporting the issue of concern to the public.</li>

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch02_s08_p01">Executives consider it an honor to have their company named one of <em class="emphasis">Business Ethics</em> magazine’s “100 Best Corporate Citizens.” Companies are chosen from a group of one thousand, according to how well they serve their stakeholders—owners, employees, customers, and the communities with which they share the social and natural environment. Being in the top one hundred for five years in a row is cause for celebration. Two of the twenty-nine companies that enjoy this distinction are Timberland and the New York Times Company.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch02_s08_p02">The two companies are in very different industries.

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch02_s08_p03">As you found out in this chapter, WorldCom’s massive accounting scandal cost investors billions and threw the company into bankruptcy. More than one hundred employees who either participated in the fraud or passively looked the other way were indicted or fired, including accountant Betty Vinson, CFO Scott Sullivan, and CEO Bernard Ebbers. With the name “WorldCom” indelibly tarnished, the company reclaimed its previous name, “MCI.” It was put on court-imposed probation and ordered to follow the directives of the court. One of those directives called for setting up an ethics office. Nancy Higgins, a corporate attorney and onetime vice president for ethics at Lockheed Martin, was brought in with the title of chief ethics officer.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch02_s08_p04">Higgins’s primary responsibility is to ensure that MCI lives up to new CEO Michael Capellas’s assertion that the company is dedicated to integrity and its employees are committed to high ethical standards. Her tasks are the same as those of most people with the same job title, but she’s under more pressure because MCI can’t afford any more ethical lapses. She oversees the company’s ethics initiatives, including training programs and an ethics hotline. She spends a lot of her time with employees, listening to their concerns and promoting company values.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch02_s08_p05">Higgins is a member of the senior executive team and reports to the CEO and board of directors. She attends all board meetings and provides members with periodic updates on the company’s newly instituted ethics program (including information gleaned from the new ethics hotline).</p>

            <li>Would you be comfortable in Higgins’s job? Does the job of ethics officer appeal to you? Why, or why not?</li>

            <li>What qualities would you look for if you were hiring an ethics officer?</li>
            <li>What factors will help (or hinder) Higgins’s ability to carry out her mandate to bolster integrity and foster ethical standards?</li>

Levi Strauss, the founder of the company that carries his name, invented blue jeans in 1850 for sale to prospectors in the gold fields of California. Company sales peaked at $7 billion in 1996 but then plummeted to $4 billion by 2003. Management has admitted that the company must reverse this downward trend if it hopes to retain the support of its twelve thousand employees, operate its remaining U.S. factories, and continue its tradition of corporate-responsibility initiatives. At this point, Wal-Mart made an attractive offer: Levi Strauss could develop a low-cost brand of jeans for sale at Wal-Mart. The decision, however, isn’t as simple as it may seem: Wal-Mart’s relentless pressure to offer “everyday low prices” can have wide-ranging ramifications for its suppliers’ stakeholders—in this case, Levi Strauss’s shareholders, employees, and customers, as well as the beneficiaries of its various social-responsibility programs. Assume that, as the CEO of Levi Strauss, you have to decide whether to accept Wal-Mart’s offer.

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch02_s08_p24">Honduras is an impoverished country in which 70% of its residents live in poverty. Jobs are scarce, particularly those that pay decent wages along with benefits, such as health care. It is not surprising then that workers at two Honduran factories making products for U.S. companies, including Nike, were extremely upset when their factories closed down and they lost their jobs. Even worse, the owners of the factories refused to pay the 1,800 workers $2 million in severance pay and other benefits due to them by law. Although the factory owners had been paid in full by Nike for the apparel they produced, the workers argued that Nike should be responsible for paying the $2 million in severance that the factory owners had not received.</p>
        <p class="para" id="collins-ch02_s08_p25">Nike’s original response was to sympathize with the workers but refuse to pay the workers the severance pay they had not received from the factory owners. This stance did not settle well with student groups around the country who rallied in support of the unpaid workers. In the end Nike gave into pressure from the students and paid $1.5 million to a relief fund for the employees. In addition, the company said it would provide vocational training and health coverage for the unemployed workers.</p>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="collins-ch02_s08_l47">

            <li>Did the students, universities, and workers themselves have all of the information they needed before becoming involved in the protest? Are their facts accurate?</li>
            <li>Should students be activists? Do companies such as Nike ignore them at their own peril?</li>
