</span> to help its casino salespeople connect to top customers on a more personal basis. Working from a prioritized list of customer names displayed on a computer screen, the salesperson clicks on a name to view relevant information about the customer, such as background and preferred casino activities. There’s even a printed script that can be used to guide the conversation. Such a system isn’t very helpful, however, to middle or top-level managers, who need systems to help them carry out their oversight and planning responsibilities. To design marketing programs, for instance, marketing managers rely on summary information gleaned from a dedicated customer-relationship management system. Let’s look at some of the widely available information systems designed to support people at the operational and upper-management levels.</p>

Using an executive information system, for example, a gaming-company executive might simply touch a screen to view key summary information that highlights in graphical form a critical area of corporate performance, such as revenue trends. After scanning this summary, our executive can “drill down” to retrieve more detailed information—for example, revenue trends by resort or revenue trends from various types of activities, such as gaming, hotel, retail, restaurant, or entertainment operations.</p>

Ever since the term was coined in 1956, artificial intelligence has always seemed on the verge of being “the next big thing.” Unfortunately, optimistic predictions eventually collided with underwhelming results, and many experts began to doubt that it would ever have profitable applications.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111128-124340-328629">“Artificial Intelligence,” <em class="emphasis">Webopedia</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/artificial_intelligence.html">http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/artificial_intelligence.html</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span> In the last decade, however, some significant advances have been made in artificial intelligence—albeit in the area of game playing, where activities are generally governed by small sets of well-defined rules. But even the game-playing environment is sometimes complex enough to promote interesting developments. In 1997, for example, IBM’s Deep Blue—a specialized computer with an advanced chess-playing program—defeated the world’s highest-ranked player.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111128-124340-328700">“Artificial Intelligence,” <em class="emphasis">Webopedia</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/artificial_intelligence.html">http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/artificial_intelligence.html</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s03_s02_s04_p02">More recently, several artificial intelligence applications have been successfully put to commercial use. Let’s take a brief look at two of these: <em class="emphasis">expert systems</em> and <em class="emphasis">face-recognition technology</em>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch15_s03_s02_s05">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Expert Systems</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s03_s02_s05_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Expert systems</a><span class="glossdef">Program that mimics the judgment of experts.</span></span> are programs that mimic the judgment of experts by following sets of rules that experts would follow. They’re useful in such diverse areas as medical diagnosis, portfolio management, and credit assessment. For example, you’ve called the customer-service department of your credit-card company because you want to increase your credit line. Don’t expect to talk to some financial expert who’s authorized to say yes or no. You’ll be talking to a service representative with no financial expertise whatsoever. He or she will, however, have access to an expert system, which will give you an answer in a few seconds. How does it work? The expert system will prompt the representative to ask you certain questions about your salary and living expenses. It will also check internal corporate data to analyze your purchases and payment behavior, and, based on the results, it will determine whether you get an increase and, if so, how much.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s03_s02_s05_p02">At Caesars, an expert system called the Revenue Management System helps to optimize the overall profitability of both hotel and casino operations. When a customer requests a room, the program accesses his or her profile in the database and consults certain “rules” for assessing the application.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111128-124533-245351">John Goff, “Head Games: Businesses Deploying Analytical Software to Get a Better Fix on Customer Behavior,” <em class="emphasis">CFO Magazine for Senior Financial Executives</em> 20:9, July 1, 2004, <a class="link" href="http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3014815">http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3014815</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span> One rule, for example, might be, “If the customer has wagered more than $100,000 in the past year, add 10 points.” Eventually, the system decides whether your application will be accepted (and at what rate) by adding up points determined by the rules. While a tightwad may not get a room even when there are vacancies, a high roller may get a good rate on a luxury suite even if the hotel is nearly full.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch15_s03_s02_s06_p01">Caesars uses another particularly interesting, and sophisticated, application of artificial intelligence. In the hotel-casino business, it’s crucial to identify and turn away undesirable visitors. One tool for this task is a digital camera-surveillance system that uses <em class="emphasis">face-recognition technology</em>. Using this technology, a program classifies a person’s face according to the presence/absence or extent of certain unique features, such as dimpled chins, receding jaws, overbites, and long or short noses. If there’s a match on, for example, fifteen features between a person being scanned and someone in the company database, a staff member decides whether the two people are the same. If a security manager then concludes that the face belongs to a skilled card-counter, the customer will be discouraged from playing blackjack; if it belongs to a known cheater, the individual will be escorted out of the casino. The system, however, does more than spot undesirables. It can also identify high rollers and send information about customers to managers on the floor. That’s why a Caesars manager can greet a preferred customer at the door with his favorite drink and a personalized greeting, such as “Hi, Bill! How’s Karen? Did you ever get that vintage Corvette? Here, have a gin rickey on the house.”<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111128-124626-267687">See Daintry Duffy, “Technology’s Winning Hand,” <em class="emphasis">CSO.online</em>, October 1, 2003, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.csoonline.com/article/218574/catching-casino-cheats-technology-s-winning-hand">http://www.csoonline.com/article/218574/catching-casino-cheats-technology-s-winning-hand</a> (accessed November 14, 2011); Larry Barrett Gallagher and Sean Gallagher, “NORA and ANNA: Non-Obvious Relationship Awareness,” <em class="emphasis">Baseline</em>, April 4, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.baselinemag.com/c/a/Past-News/NORA-and-ANNA/">http://www.baselinemag.com/c/a/Past-News/NORA-and-ANNA/</a> (accessed November 14, 2011).</span></p>
