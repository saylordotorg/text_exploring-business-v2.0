        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s06_p01">If you want to start a business, you must prepare a business plan. This essential document should tell the story of your business concept, provide an overview of the industry in which you will operate, describe the goods or services you will provide, identify your customers and proposed marketing activities, explain the qualifications of your management team, and state your projected income and borrowing needs.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch05_s06_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Purpose of a Business Plan</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s06_s01_p01">The business plan is a plan or blueprint for the company, and it’s an indispensable tool in attracting investors, obtaining loans, or both. Remember, too, that the value of your business plan isn’t limited to the planning stages of your business and the process of finding start-up money. Once you’ve acquired start-up capital, don’t just stuff your plan in a drawer. Treat it as an ongoing guide to your business and its operations, as well as a yardstick by which you can measure your performance. Keep it handy, update it periodically, and use it to assess your progress.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s06_s01_p02">In developing and writing your business plan, you must make strategic decisions in the areas of management, operations, marketing, accounting, and finance—in short, in all the functional areas of business that we described in <a class="xref" href="collins-ch01#collins-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Foundations of Business"</a>. Granted, preparing a business plan takes a lot of time and work, but it’s well worth the effort. A business plan forces you to think critically about your proposed business and reduces your risk of failure. It forces you to analyze your business concept and the industry in which you’ll be operating, and it helps you determine how you can grab a percentage of sales in that industry.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s06_s01_p03">The most common use of a business plan is persuading investors, lenders, or both, to provide financing. These two groups look for different things. Investors are particularly interested in the quality of your business concept and the ability of management to make your venture successful. Bankers and other lenders are primarily concerned with your company’s ability to generate cash to repay loans. To persuade investors and lenders to support your business, you need a professional, well-written business plan that paints a clear picture of your proposed business.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch05_s06_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Sections of the Business Plan</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s06_s02_p01">Though formats can vary, a business plan generally includes the following sections: executive summary, description of proposed business, industry analysis, mission statement and core values, management plan, goods or services and (if applicable) production processes, marketing, global issues, and financial plan. Let’s explore each of these sections in more detail. (<em class="emphasis">Note</em>: More detailed documents and an Excel template are available for those classes in which the optional business plan project is assigned.)</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch05_s06_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Executive Summary</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s06_s02_s01_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">executive summary</a><span class="glossdef">Overview emphasizing the key points of a business plan to get the reader excited about the business’s prospects.</span></span> is a one- to three-page overview of the business plan. It’s actually the most important part of the business plan: it’s what the reader looks at first, and if it doesn’t capture the reader’s attention, it might be the only thing that he or she looks at. It should therefore emphasize the key points of the plan and get the reader excited about the prospects of the business.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s06_s02_s01_p02">Even though the executive summary is the first thing read, it’s written <em class="emphasis">after</em> the other sections of the plan are completed. An effective approach in writing the executive summary is to paraphrase key sentences from each section of the business plan. This process will ensure that the key information of each section is included in the executive summary.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s06_s02_s02_p01">Here, you present a <em class="emphasis">brief</em> description of the company and tell the reader why you’re starting your business, what benefits it provides, and why it will be successful. Some of the questions to answer in this section include the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch05_s06_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>What will your proposed company do? Will it be a manufacturer, a retailer, or a service provider?</li>
                <li>What goods or services will it provide?</li>
                <li>Why are your goods or services unique?</li>
                <li>Who will be your main customers?</li>

            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch05_s06_s02_s02_p02">Because later parts of the plan will provide more detailed discussions of many of these issues, this section should provide only an overview of these topics.</p>

It tells the reader what the organization is committed to doing. For example, one mission statement reads, “The mission of Southwest Airlines is dedication to the highest quality of customer service delivered with a sense of warmth, friendliness, individual pride, and company spirit.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn05_034">Southwest Airline’s company Web site, about SWA section, <a class="link" href="http://www.southwest.com/about_swa/mission.html">http://www.southwest.com/about_swa/mission.html</a> (accessed August 31, 2011).</span></p>
