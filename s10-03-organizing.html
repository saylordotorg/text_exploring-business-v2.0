        <h2 class="title editable block">Levels of Management: How Managers Are Organized</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s01_p01">A typical organization has several layers of management. Think of these layers as forming a pyramid like the one in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch06_s03_s01_f01">Figure 6.3 "Levels of Management"</a>, with top managers occupying the narrow space at the peak, first-line managers the broad base, and middle-managers the levels in between. As you move up the pyramid, management positions get more demanding, but they carry more authority and responsibility (along with more power, prestige, and pay). Top managers spend most of their time in planning and decision making, while first-line managers focus on day-to-day operations. For obvious reasons, there are far more people with positions at the base of the pyramid than there are with jobs at the other two levels (as you get to the top, there are only a few positions). Let’s look at each management level in more detail.</p>

Top-level executives routinely scan the external environment for opportunities and threats, and they redirect company efforts when needed. They spend a considerable portion of their time planning and making major decisions. They represent the company in important dealings with other businesses and government agencies, and they promote it to the public.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Organizational Structure: How Companies Get the Job Done</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s02_p01">The organizing process raises some important questions: What jobs need to be done? Who does what? Who reports to whom? What are the formal relationships among people in the organization? You provide answers to these questions by developing an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">organizational structure</a><span class="glossdef">Organizational arrangement of jobs in an organization that’s most appropriate for the company at a specific point in time.</span></span>: an arrangement of positions that’s most appropriate for your company at a specific point in time. Remember, given the rapidly changing environment in which businesses operate, a structure that works today might be outdated tomorrow. That’s why you hear so often about companies <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">restructuring</a><span class="glossdef">Process of altering an existing organizational structure to become more competitive under changing conditions.</span></span>—altering existing organizational structures to become more competitive under conditions that have changed. In building an organizational structure, you engage in two activities: <em class="emphasis">job specialization</em> (dividing tasks into jobs) and <em class="emphasis">departmentalization</em> (grouping jobs into units). We’ll now see how these two processes are accomplished.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch06_s03_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Specialization</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s02_s01_p01">The first step in designing an organizational structure is twofold:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>Identifying the activities that need to be performed in order to achieve organizational goals.</li>
                <li>Breaking down these activities into tasks that can be performed by individuals or groups of employees.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s02_s01_p02">This twofold process of organizing activities into clusters of related tasks that can be handled by certain individuals or groups is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">specialization</a><span class="glossdef">Process of organizing activities into clusters of related tasks that can be handled by specific individuals or groups.</span></span>. Its purpose is to improve efficiency.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s02_s01_p03">Would specialization make Notes-4-You more efficient? You could have each employee perform all tasks entailed by taking and selling notes. Each employee could take notes in an assigned class, type them up, get them copied, and sell them outside the classroom at the start of the next class meeting. The same person would keep track of all sales and copying costs and give any profit—sales minus copying costs minus compensation—to you. The process seems simple, but is it really <em class="emphasis">efficient</em>? Will you earn the maximum amount of profit? Probably not. Even a company as small as Notes-4-You can benefit from specialization. It would function more efficiently if some employees specialized in taking notes, others in copying and packaging them, and still others in selling them. Higher-level employees could focus on advertising, accounting, finance, and human resources.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s02_s01_p04">Obviously, specialization has advantages. In addition to increasing efficiency, for example, it results in jobs that are easier to learn. But it has disadvantages, too. Doing the same thing over and over bores people and will eventually leave employees dissatisfied with their jobs. Before long, you’ll notice decreased performance and increased absenteeism and turnover.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch06_s03_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Departmentalization</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s02_s02_p01">The next step in designing an organizational structure is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">departmentalization</a><span class="glossdef">Process of grouping specialized jobs into meaningful units.</span></span>—grouping specialized jobs into meaningful units. Depending on the organization and the size of the work units, they may be called <em class="emphasis">divisions, departments</em>, or just plain <em class="emphasis">groups</em>. Traditional groupings of jobs result in different organizational structures, and for the sake of simplicity, we’ll focus on two types—<em class="emphasis">functional</em> and <em class="emphasis">divisional organizations</em>.</p>
            <div class="section" id="collins-ch06_s03_s02_s02_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Functional Organization</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s02_s02_s01_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">functional organization</a><span class="glossdef">Form of business organization that groups together people who have comparable skills and perform similar tasks.</span></span> groups together people who have comparable skills and perform similar tasks. This form of organization is fairly typical for small to medium-size companies, which group their people by business functions: accountants are grouped together, as are people in finance, marketing and sales, human resources, production, and research and development. Each unit is headed by an individual with expertise in the unit’s particular function. The head of an accounting department, for example, will be a senior accountant; the head of a hospital nursing unit will obviously be an experienced nurse. This structure is also appropriate for nonprofits. Think about your school, for instance: mathematics teachers are in the math department, history teachers are in the history department, those who run athletic programs are in the athletic department, and librarians work at the library.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s02_s02_s01_p02">If Notes-4-You adopted a functional approach to departmentalization, jobs might be grouped into four clusters:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s02_s02_s01_l01">
                    <li>Human resources (hiring, training, and evaluating employees)</li>
                    <li>Operations (overseeing notetakers and copiers)</li>
                    <li>Marketing (arranging for advertising, sales, and distribution)</li>
                    <li>Accounting (handling cash collection and disbursement)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s02_s02_s01_p03">There are a number of advantages to the functional approach. The structure is simple to understand and enables the staff to specialize in particular areas; everyone in the marketing group would probably have similar interests and expertise. But homogeneity also has drawbacks: it can hinder communication and decision making between units and even promote interdepartmental conflict. The marketing department, for example, might butt heads with the accounting department because marketers want to spend as much as possible on advertising, while accountants want to control costs. Marketers might feel that accountants are too tight with funds, and accountants might regard marketers as spendthrifts.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s02_s02_s02_p01">Large companies often find it unruly to operate as one large unit under a functional organizational structure. Sheer size makes it difficult for managers to oversee operations and serve customers. To rectify this problem, most large companies are structured as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">divisional organizations</a><span class="glossdef">Form of organization that groups people into several smaller, self-contained units, or divisions, which are accountable for their own performance.</span></span> made up of several smaller, self-contained units, or divisions, which are accountable for their own performance. Each division functions autonomously because it contains all the functional expertise (production, marketing, accounting, finance, human resources) needed to meet its objectives. The challenge is to find the most appropriate way of structuring operations to achieve overall company goals. Toward this end, divisions can be formed according to <em class="emphasis">products, customers, processes</em>, or <em class="emphasis">geography</em>.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s02_s02_s04_p01">Some companies prefer a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">customer division</a><span class="glossdef">Organizational structure that groups employees into customer-based business segments.</span></span> structure because it enables them to better serve their various categories of customers. Thus, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s two hundred or so operating companies are grouped into three customer-based business segments: consumer business (personal-care and hygiene products sold to the general public), pharmaceuticals (prescription drugs sold to pharmacists), and professional business (medical devices and diagnostics products used by physicians, optometrists, hospitals, laboratories, and clinics).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn06_012">Johnson &amp; Johnson Services, “Business Segments,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jnj.com/connect/about-jnj/company-structure">http://www.jnj.com/connect/about-jnj/company-structure</a> (accessed October 8, 2011).</span></p>

This form works well at Bowater Thunder Bay, a Canadian company that harvests trees and processes wood into newsprint and pulp. The first step in the production process is harvesting and stripping trees. Then, large logs are sold to lumber mills and smaller logs chopped up and sent to Bowater’s mills. At the mill, wood chips are chemically converted into pulp. About 90 percent is sold to other manufacturers (as raw material for home and office products), and the remaining 10 percent is further processed into newspaper print. Bowater, then, has three divisions: tree cutting, chemical processing, and finishing (which makes newsprint).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn06_013">Northwest Forest Industry, Pulp and Paper Manufacturing, “From the Forest to the Office and Home: Bowater—A Case Study in Newsprint and Kraft Pulp Production,” <em class="emphasis">Borealforest.org</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.borealforest.org/paper/index.htm">http://www.borealforest.org/paper/index.htm</a> (accessed October 8, 2011).</span></p>

The next level identifies the people who work for these managers. Because you’ve started out small, neither your accounting manager nor your human resources manager will be currently managing anyone directly. Your marketing manager, however, will oversee one person in advertising and a sales supervisor (who, in turn, oversees the sales staff). Your operations manager will oversee two individuals—one to supervise notetakers and one to supervise the people responsible for making copies.</p>

Because four managers report to you, you’ll be connected to four positions; that is, you’ll have four direct “reports.” Your marketing and operations managers will each be connected to two positions and their supervisors to one position each. The organization chart shows that if a member of the sales staff has a problem, he or she will report it to the sales supervisor. If the sales supervisor believes that the problem should be addressed at a higher level, then he or she will report it to the marketing manager.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s03_s01_p02">Theoretically, you will communicate only with your four direct reports, but this isn’t the way things normally work.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s03_s01_p04">Over time, companies revise their organizational structures to accommodate growth and changes in the external environment. It’s not uncommon, for example, for a firm to adopt a functional structure in its early years. Then, as it becomes bigger and more complex, it might move to a divisional structure—perhaps to accommodate new products or to become more responsive to certain customers or geographical areas. Some companies might ultimately rely on a combination of functional and divisional structures. This could be a good approach for a credit card company that issues cards in both the United States and Europe. A skeleton of this firm’s organization chart might look like the one in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch06_s03_s03_s01_f02">Figure 6.7 "Organization Chart: Combination Divisional and Functional Structures"</a>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s03_s02_p01">You can learn a lot about a firm’s reporting and authority relationships by looking at its organization chart. To whom does a particular person report? Does each person report to one or more supervisors? How many people does a manager supervise? How many layers are there, for example, between the top managerial position and the lowest managerial level?</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s03_s02_s01_p01">The vertical connecting lines in the organization chart show the firm’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chain of command</a><span class="glossdef">Authority and reporting relationships among people working at different levels of an organization.</span></span>: the authority relationships among people working at different levels of the organization. That is to say, they show <em class="emphasis">who reports to whom</em>. When you’re examining an organization chart, you’ll probably want to know whether each person reports to one or more supervisors: to what extent, in other words, is there <em class="emphasis">unity of command</em>? To understand why unity of command is an important organizational feature, think about it from a personal standpoint. Would you want to report to more than one boss? What happens if you get conflicting directions? Whose directions would you follow?</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s03_s02_s01_p02">There are, however, conditions under which an organization and its employees can benefit by violating the unity-of-command principle.

To design new products, the company may create product teams made up of designers, marketers, and other specialists with expertise in particular sports categories—say, running shoes or basketball shoes. Each team member would be evaluated by both the team manager and the head of his or her functional department.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s03_s02_s02_p01">Another thing to notice about a firm’s chain of command is the number of layers between the top managerial position and the lowest managerial level. As a rule, new organizations (such as Notes-4-You) have only a few layers of management—an organizational structure that’s often called <em class="emphasis">flat</em>. Let’s say, for instance, that a member of the Notes-4-You sales staff wanted to express concern about slow sales among a certain group of students. That person’s message would have to filter upward through only two management layers—the sales supervisor and the marketing manager—before reaching the president.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s03_s02_s02_p02">As a company grows, however, it tends to add more layers between the top and the bottom; that is, it gets <em class="emphasis">taller</em>. Added layers of management can slow down communication and decision making, causing the organization to become less efficient and productive. That’s one reason why many of today’s organizations are restructuring to become flatter.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s03_s02_s02_p03">There are trade-offs between the advantages and disadvantages of flat and tall organizations. Companies determine which trade-offs to make according to a principle called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">span of control</a><span class="glossdef">Number of people reporting to a particular manager.</span></span>, which measures the number of people reporting to a particular manager. If, for example, you remove layers of management to make your organization flatter, you end up increasing the number of positions reporting to a particular supervisor. If you refer back to the organization chart in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch06_s03_s03_f01">Figure 6.5 "Organization Chart for Notes-4-You"</a>, you’ll recall that, under your present structure, four managers report to you as the president of Notes-4-You: the heads of accounting, marketing, operations, and human resources. In turn, two of these managers have positions reporting to them: the advertising manager and sales supervisor report to the marketing manager, while the notetaker’s supervisor and the copier’s supervisor report to the operations manager. Let’s say that you remove a layer of management by getting rid of the marketing and operations managers. Your organization would be flatter, but what would happen to your workload? As president, you’d now have six direct reports rather than four: accounting manager, advertising manager, sales manager, notetaker supervisor, copier supervisor, and human resources manager.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s03_s02_s02_p04">What’s better—a <em class="emphasis">narrow</em> span of control (with few direct reports) or a <em class="emphasis">wide</em> span of control (with many direct reports)? The answer to this question depends on a number of factors, including frequency and type of interaction, proximity of subordinates, competence of both supervisor and subordinates, and the nature of the work being supervised. For example, you’d expect a much wider span of control at a nonprofit call center than in a hospital emergency room.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s03_s02_s05_p02">Let’s say that you favor decentralizing Notes-4-You some four or five years down the road, when the company has expanded. Naturally, there are some decisions—such as strategic planning—that you won’t delegate to lower-level employees, but you could certainly delegate the management of copy-center operations. In fact, putting someone in charge of this function would probably improve customer satisfaction, because copy-center customers would be dealing directly with the manager. It would also give the manager valuable decision-making experience, and while he or she is busy making daily decisions about the copy center, you’ll have more time to work on higher-level tasks. The more you think about the possibility of decentralizing your company, the more you like the idea. First, though, you have to see it through its difficult start-up years.</p>

                        <li>Managers coordinate the activities identified in the planning process among individuals, departments, or other units and allocate the resources needed to perform them.</li>
                        <li>Typically, there are three levels of management: <strong class="emphasis bold">top managers</strong>, who are responsible for overall performance; <strong class="emphasis bold">middle managers</strong>, who report to top managers and oversee lower-level managers; and <strong class="emphasis bold">first-line managers</strong>, who supervise employees to make sure that work is performed correctly and on time.</li>
                        <li>Management must develop an <strong class="emphasis bold">organizational structure</strong>, or arrangement of people within the organization, that will best achieve company goals.</li>
                        <li>The process begins with <strong class="emphasis bold">specialization</strong>—dividing necessary tasks into jobs; the principle of grouping jobs into units is called <strong class="emphasis bold">departmentalization</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Units are then grouped into an appropriate organizational structure. <strong class="emphasis bold">Functional organization</strong> groups people with comparable skills and tasks; <strong class="emphasis bold">divisional organization</strong> creates a structure composed of self-contained units based on <strong class="emphasis bold">product</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">customer</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">process</strong>, or <strong class="emphasis bold">geographical division</strong>.

Your career path at Hershey Foods might follow a typical path: When you finish college, you may enter the business world as a first-line manager. After about ten years, you will probably have advanced to the middle-management level. Perhaps you’ll keep moving up and eventually find yourself in a top-level management position with a big salary. Examining job opportunities may be an opportunity to start identifying the kinds of positions that interest you. Go to <a class="link" href="http://www.hersheys.com">http://www.hersheys.com</a> to link to the Hershey Foods Web site, click on “careers” at the bottom of the home page, and check out available positions. Then, take the following steps:</p>
