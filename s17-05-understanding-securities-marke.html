    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_p01">So, before long, you’re a publicly traded company. Fortunately, because your degree in finance comes with a better-than-average knowledge of financial markets, you’re familiar with the ways in which investors will evaluate your company. Investors will look at the overall quality of the company and ask some basic questions:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_l02">
        <li>How well is it managed?</li>
        <li>Is it in a growing industry? Is its market share increasing or decreasing?</li>
        <li>Does it have a good line of products? Is it coming out with innovative products?</li>
        <li>How is the company doing relative to its competitors?</li>
        <li>What is its future? What is the future of its industry?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_p02">Investors also analyze the company’s performance over time and ask more-specific questions:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_l03">
        <li>Are its sales growing?</li>
        <li>Is its income going up?</li>
        <li>Is its stock price rising or falling?</li>
        <li>Are earnings per share rising?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_p03">They’ll assess the company’s financial strength, asking another series of specific questions:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_l04">
        <li>Can it pay its bills on time?</li>
        <li>Does it have too much debt?</li>
        <li>Is it managing its productive assets (such as inventory) efficiently?</li>
    </ul>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Primary and Secondary Markets and Stock Exchanges</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_s01_p01">Security markets serve two functions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_s01_l01">
            <li>They help companies to raise funds by making the initial sale of their stock to the public.</li>
            <li>They provide a place where investors can trade already issued stock.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_s01_p02">When you went through your IPO, shares were issued through a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">primary market</a><span class="glossdef">Market that deals in the sale of newly issued securities.</span></span>—a market that deals in new financial assets. As we’ve seen, the sale was handled by an investment banking firm, which matched you, as a corporation with stock to sell, with investors who wanted to buy it.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s05_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Organized Exchanges</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_s01_s01_p01">After a certain time elapsed, investors began buying and selling your stock on a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">secondary market</a><span class="glossdef">Market in which investors buy previously issued securities from other investors.</span></span>. The proceeds of sales on this market go to the investor who sells the stock, not to your company. The best-known of these markets is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)</a><span class="glossdef">Best-known stock market where stocks of the largest, most prestigious corporations are traded.</span></span>,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn13_024">The official name of the New York Stock Exchange is the “NYSE Euronext.” Its name was formed following its merger with the fully electronic stock exchange Euronext.

Other exchanges, including the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">American Stock Exchange (AMEX)</a><span class="glossdef">Stock market where shares of smaller companies are traded.</span></span> and regional exchanges located in places like Chicago and Boston, trade the stock of smaller companies.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">OTC Markets</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_s01_s02_p01">Note that a “market” doesn’t have to be a physical location. In the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">over-the-counter (OTC) market</a><span class="glossdef">Market in which securities are traded over computer networks and phones rather than on the trading floor of an exchange.</span></span>, securities are traded among dealers over computer networks or by phone rather than on the floor of an organized exchange. Though there are exceptions, stocks traded in the OTC market are generally those of smaller (and often riskier) companies. The best-known OTC electronic-exchange system is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">NASDAQ</a><span class="glossdef">Best-known over-the-counter, electronic exchange system.</span></span> (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system). It’s home to almost five thousand corporations, many of them technology companies.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Regulating Securities Markets: The SEC</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_s02_p01">Because it’s vital that investors have confidence in the securities markets, Congress created the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a><span class="glossdef">Government agency that enforces securities laws.</span></span> in 1934. The SEC is charged with enforcing securities laws designed to promote full public disclosure, protecting investors against misconduct in the securities markets, and maintaining the integrity of the securities markets.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn13_016">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, <a class="link" href="http://www.sec.gov">http://www.sec.gov</a> (accessed November 8, 2011).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_s02_p02">Before offering securities for sale, the issuer must register its intent to sell with the SEC. In addition, the issuer must provide prospective buyers with a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">prospectus</a><span class="glossdef">Written offer to sell securities that provides useful information to prospective buyers.</span></span>—a written offer to sell securities that describes the business and operations of the issuer, lists its officers, provides financial information, discloses any pending litigation, and states the proposed use of funds from the sale.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_s02_p03">The SEC also enforces laws against <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">insider trading</a><span class="glossdef">Practice of buying or selling of securities using important information about the company before it’s made public.</span></span>—the illegal buying or selling of its securities by a firm’s officers and directors or anyone else taking advantage of valuable information about the company before it’s made public. The intent of these laws is to prevent insiders from profiting at the expense of other investors.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Measuring Market Performance: Market Indexes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_s03_p01">Throughout the day, you can monitor the general drift of the stock market by watching any major news network and following the band at the bottom of your TV. News channels and broadcasts generally feature a market recap in the evening. Even music-oriented radio stations break for a minute of news every now and then, including a quick review of the stock market. Almost all these reports refer to one or more of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">market indexes</a><span class="glossdef">Measure for tracking stock prices.</span></span> with which investors can track trends in stock price. Let’s look more closely at some of these indicators.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch13_s05_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Dow</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_s03_s01_p01">By far the most widely reported market index is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)</a><span class="glossdef">Market index that reflects the total value of a “market basket” of thirty large U.S. companies.</span></span>, or “the Dow.” The Dow is the total value of a “market basket” of thirty large companies headquartered in the United States. They aren’t the thirty largest or best-performing companies, but rather a group selected by the senior staff members at the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> to represent a broad spectrum of the U.S. economy, as well as a variety of industries. The thirty selected stocks change over time, but the list usually consists of household names, such as AT&amp;T, Coca-Cola, Disney, IBM, General Electric, and Wal-Mart.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_s03_s01_p02">The graph in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch13_s05_s03_s01_f01">Figure 13.9 "DJIA for Ten-Year Period Ended November 2011"</a> tracks the Dow for the ten-year period ended November 2011. The market measured by the Dow was on an upward swing from 2002 until it peaked in October 2007 at its all-time high of 14,200. At that point, it headed down until it reached a low point in March 2008 of 6,500 (a 54 percent drop from its all-time high). It has since crawled back up to 12,000, which is still 15 percent below its previous high. The path of the DOW during this ten-year period has been very volatile (subject to up and down movements in response to unstable worldwide economic and political situations).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn13_025">“History of the Dow Jones Industrial Average,” MD Leasing Corporation, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mdleasing.com/djia.htm">http://www.mdleasing.com/djia.htm</a> (accessed November 8, 2011).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_s04_p01">Businesspeople—both owners and managers—monitor their stock prices on a daily basis. They want the value of their stock to rise for both professional and personal reasons. Stock price, for example, is a sort of “report card” on the company’s progress, and it reflects the success of its managers in running the company. Many managers have a great deal of personal wealth tied directly to the fortunes of the companies for which they work.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch13_s05_s04_p02">If you have any interest in investing, you’ll want to know how to interpret stock market information.

Here are some of the highlights: The stock has done poorly for the past twelve-month period. Its price has dropped by more than 25 percent. The closing stock price of $57.38 falls right in the middle of the annual high of $60.96 and the annual low of $45.67. The company pays an annual dividend of $1.38 per share (which gives investors a fairly good cash return on their stock of 2.40 percent).
