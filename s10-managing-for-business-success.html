<span class="title-prefix">Chapter 6</span> Managing for Business Success</h1>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch06_s00">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Noteworthy Management</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s00_p01">Consider this scenario. You’re about halfway through the semester and ready for your first round of midterms. You open up your class notes and declare them “pathetic.” You regret scribbling everything so carelessly (and skipping class so many times). You wish you had better notes. That’s when it hits you: What if there was a note-taking service on campus? When you were ready to study for a big test, you could buy complete (and completely legible) class notes. You’ve heard that there are class-notes services at some larger schools, but there’s no such thing on your campus. So you ask yourself, why don’t I start a note-taking business? My upcoming set of exams may not be salvageable, but after that, I’d always have great notes. And while I was at it, I could learn how to manage a business (isn’t that what majoring in business is all about?).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s00_p02">So you sit down to work on your great business idea. First, you’ll hire a bunch of students to take class notes and type them out. Then the notetakers will e-mail the notes to your assistant, who’ll get them copied (on a special type of blue paper that can’t be duplicated). The last step will be assembling packages of notes and, of course, selling them. You decide to name your company “Notes-4-You.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s00_p03">It sounds like a great idea, but you’re troubled by one question: Why does this business need <em class="emphasis">you</em>? Do the notetakers need a boss? Couldn’t they just sell the notes themselves? This process <em class="emphasis">could</em> work, but it would probably work a lot <em class="emphasis">better</em> if there was someone to oversee the operations: a manager—someone like you—to make sure that the operations involved in preparing and selling notes were performed in both an effective and an efficient manner. You’d make the process <em class="emphasis">effective</em> by ensuring that the right things got done and that they all contributed to the success of the enterprise. You’d make the process <em class="emphasis">efficient</em> by ensuring that activities were performed in the right way and used the fewest possible resources. That’s the job that you perform as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">manager</a><span class="glossdef">Individual in an organization who is responsible for making a group of people more effective and efficient.</span></span>: making a group of people more <em class="emphasis">effective</em> and <em class="emphasis">efficient</em> with you than they would be without you.</p>

A <em class="emphasis">plan</em> enables you to take your business concept beyond the idea stage. It does not, however, get the work <em class="emphasis">done</em>. You have to <em class="emphasis">organize</em> things if you want your plan to become a reality. You have to put people and other resources in place to make things happen. And because your note-taking venture is supposed to be better off with you in charge, you need to be a <em class="emphasis">leader</em> who can motivate your people to do well. Finally, to know whether things are in fact going well, you’ll have to <em class="emphasis">control</em> your operations—that is, measure the results and compare them with the results that you laid out in your plan. <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch06_s01_f01">Figure 6.1 "The Role of Planning"</a> gives you a good idea of the interrelationship between planning and the other functions that managers perform.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_p01">Without a plan, it’s hard to succeed at anything. The reason is simple: if you don’t know where you’re going, you can’t really move forward. Successful managers decide where they want to be and then figure out how to get there. In <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">planning</a><span class="glossdef">Process of setting goals and determining the best way to achieve them.</span></span>, managers set goals and determine the best way to achieve them. As a result of the planning process, everyone in the organization knows what should be done, who should do it, and how it should be done.</p>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch06_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Developing a Strategic Plan</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s01_p01">Coming up with an idea—say, starting a note-taking business—is a good start, but it’s only a start. Planning for it is a step forward. Planning begins at the highest level and works its way down through the organization. Step one is usually called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">strategic planning</a><span class="glossdef">Process of establishing an overall plan or course of action for an organization.</span></span>, which is the process of establishing an overall course of action. To begin this process, you should ask yourself a couple of very basic questions: Why, for example, does the organization exist? What value does it create? Sam Walton posed these questions in the process of founding Wal-Mart: his new chain of stores would exist to offer customers the lowest prices with the best possible service.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn06_001">Lee Scott, “Three Basic Beliefs,” <em class="emphasis">About Wal-Mart</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.walmartstores.com/GlobalWMStoresWeb/navigate.do?catg=252">http://www.walmartstores.com/GlobalWMStoresWeb/navigate.do?catg=252</a> (accessed May 3, 2006).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s01_p02">After you’ve identified the purpose of your company, you’re ready to take the remaining steps in the strategic-planning process:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>Write a mission statement that tells customers, employees, and others why your organization exists.</li>
            <li>Identify core values or beliefs that will guide the behavior of members of the organization.</li>
            <li>Assess the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.</li>
            <li>Establish goals and objectives, or performance targets, to direct all the activities that you’ll perform to achieve your mission.</li>
            <li>Develop and implement tactical and operational plans to achieve goals and objectives.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s01_p03">In the next few sections, we’ll examine these components of the strategic-planning process.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch06_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Mission Statement</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s02_p01">As we saw in an earlier chapter, the <em class="emphasis">mission statement</em> describes the purpose of your organization—the reason for its existence. It tells the reader what the organization is committed to doing. It can be very concise, like the one from Mary Kay Inc. (the cosmetics company): “To enrich the lives of women around the world.”<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111110-141105-315759">Mary Kay Inc.

We fuel the passion for freedom in our customers to express their own individuality.”<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111110-141105-315838">Harley-Davidson Web site, Company/Student Center section, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.harley-davidson.com/en_GB/Content/Pages/Company/company.html?locale=en_GB&amp;bmLocale=enGB">http://www.harley-davidson.com/en_GB/Content/Pages/Company/company.html?locale=en_GB&amp;bmLocale=enGB</a> (accessed September 21, 2011).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s02_p02">What about Notes-4-You? What should your mission statement say? A simple, concise mission statement for your enterprise could be the following: “To provide high-quality class notes to college students.” On the other hand, you could prepare a more detailed statement that explains what the company is committed to doing, who its customers are, what its focus is, what goods or services it provides, and how it serves its customers. In that case, your mission statement might be the following:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="collins-ch06_s02_s02_p03">“Notes-4-You is committed to earning the loyalty of college students through its focus on customer service. It provides high-quality, dependable, competitively priced class notes that help college students master complex academic subjects.”</p>
        </span>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch06_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Core Values</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s03_p01">Having defined your mission, your next step is to ask, what does this organization stand for? What values will define it? What principles should guide our actions as we build and operate the business? In <a class="xref" href="collins-ch02#collins-ch02">Chapter 2 "Business Ethics and Social Responsibility"</a>, we explained that the small set of guiding principles that you identify as crucial to your company are known as <em class="emphasis">core values</em>—fundamental beliefs about what’s important and what is and isn’t appropriate in conducting company activities. Core values affect the overall planning processes and operations. At Volvo, for example, three core values—safety, quality, and environmental care—define the firm’s “approach to product development, design and production.”<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111110-141401-399578">Volvo Group Global, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.volvogroup.com/group/global/en-gb/volvo%20group/our_brand/volvo/Pages/volvo.aspx">http://www.volvogroup.com/group/global/en-gb/volvo%20group/our_brand/volvo/Pages/volvo.aspx</a> (accessed September 21, 2011).</span> Core values should also guide the behavior of every individual in the organization. Coca-Cola, for instance, reports that its stated core values—leadership, collaboration, integrity, accountability, passion, diversity and quality—tell employees exactly what behaviors are acceptable.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111110-141401-399664">The Coca-Cola Company, “Code of Business Conduct,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/ourcompany/mission_vision_values.html">http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/ourcompany/mission_vision_values.html</a> (accessed September 21, 2011).</span> How do companies communicate core values to employees and hold them accountable for putting those values into practice? They link core values to performance evaluations and compensation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s03_p02">In choosing core values for Notes-4-You, you’re determined not to fall back on some list of the world’s most popular core values: ethics/integrity, accountability, respect for others, and open communication.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn06_006">“Most Executives Say Ethics, Integrity Are Among Core Corporate Values,” allBusiness, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.allbusiness.com/reports-reviews-sections/polls-surveys/11427605-1.html">http://www.allbusiness.com/reports-reviews-sections/polls-surveys/11427605-1.html</a> (accessed October 9, 2011).</span> You want yours to be unique to Notes-4-You. After some thought, you settle on <em class="emphasis">teamwork, trust</em>, and <em class="emphasis">dependability</em>. Why these three? As you plan your business, you realize that it will need a workforce that functions as a team, trusts each other, and can be depended on to satisfy customers. In building your workforce, you’ll seek employees who’ll embrace these values.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch06_s02_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Conduct a SWOT Analysis</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s04_p01">The next step in the strategic-planning process is to assess your company’s fit with its environment. A common approach to <em class="emphasis">environmental analysis</em> is matching the strengths of your business with the opportunities available to it. It’s called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">SWOT analysis</a><span class="glossdef">Approach used to assess a company’s fit with its environment by analyzing its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.</span></span> because it calls for analyzing an organization’s Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. It begins with an examination of <em class="emphasis">external</em> factors that could influence the company in either a positive or a negative way. These could include economic conditions, competition, emerging technologies, laws and regulations, and customers’ expectations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s04_p02">One purpose of assessing the external environment is to identify both <em class="emphasis">opportunities</em> that could benefit the company and <em class="emphasis">threats</em> to its success. For example, a company that manufactures children’s bicycle helmets would view a change in federal law requiring all children to wear helmets as an opportunity. The news that two large sports-equipment companies were coming out with bicycle helmets would be a threat.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s04_p03">The next step is to evaluate the company’s strengths and weaknesses. <em class="emphasis">Strengths</em> might include a motivated workforce, state-of-the-art technology, impressive managerial talent, or a desirable location. The opposite of any of these strengths (poor workforce, obsolete technology, incompetent management, or poor location) could signal a potential <em class="emphasis">weakness</em>. Armed with a good idea of external opportunities and threats, as well as internal strengths and weaknesses, managers want to capitalize on opportunities by taking advantage of organizational strengths. Likewise, they want to protect the organization from both external threats and internal weaknesses.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s04_p04">Let’s start with our strengths. Now that we know what they are, how do we match them with our available opportunities (while also protecting ourselves from our threats and overcoming our weaknesses)? Here’s a possibility: By providing excellent service and price while we’re still small (with few customers and low costs), we can solidify our position on campus. When the market grows (as it will, because of the increase in the number of classes—especially those at 8:00 a.m.—and increases in student enrollment), we’ll have built a strong reputation and will put ourselves in a position to grow. So even if a competitor comes to campus (a threat), we’ll be the preferred supplier of class notes. This strategy will work only if we make sure that our notetakers are dependable and that we don’t alienate the faculty or administration.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch06_s02_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Set Goals and Objectives</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s05_p01">Your mission statement affirms what your organization is <em class="emphasis">generally</em> committed to doing, but it doesn’t tell you <em class="emphasis">how</em> to do it. So the next step in the strategic-planning process is establishing goals and objectives. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Goals</a><span class="glossdef">Major accomplishments that a company wants to achieve over a long period of time.</span></span> are major accomplishments that the company wants to achieve over a long period (say, five years). <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Objectives</a><span class="glossdef">Intermediate-term performance targets that direct the activities of an organization toward the attainment of a goal.</span></span> are shorter-term performance targets that direct the activities of the organization toward the attainment of a goal. They should be clearly stated, attainable, and measurable: they should give target dates for the completion of tasks and stipulate who’s responsible for taking necessary actions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn06_007">Scott Safranski and Ik-Whan Kwon, “Strategic Planning for the Growing Business” (1991), U.S. Small Business Administration, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sbaonline.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_pubs_eb_pdf_eb6.pdf">http://www.sbaonline.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_pubs_eb_pdf_eb6.pdf</a> (accessed October 9, 2011).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s05_p02">An organization will have a number of goals and related objectives. Some will focus on financial measures, such as profit maximization and sales growth. Others will target operational efficiency or quality control. Still others will govern the company’s relationships with its employees, its community, its environment, or all three.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s05_p03">Finally, goals and objectives change over time. As a firm reassesses its place in its business environment, it rethinks not only its mission but also its approach to fulfilling it. The reality of change was a major theme when the late McDonald’s CEO Jim Cantalupo explained his goal to revitalize the company:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s05_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="collins-ch06_s02_s05_p04">“The world has changed. Our customers have changed. We have to change too. Growth comes from being better, not just expanding to have more restaurants. The new McDonald’s is focused on building sales at existing restaurants rather than on adding new restaurants. We are introducing a new level of discipline and efficiency to all aspects of the business and are setting a new bar for performance.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn06_008">McDonald’s Corp., “McDonald’s Announces Plans to Revitalize Its Worldwide Business and Sets New Financial Targets,” Franchise Bison, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bison.com/press_mcdonalds_04072003">http://www.bison.com/press_mcdonalds_04072003</a> (accessed October 8, 2011).</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s05_p05">This change in focus was accompanied by specific performance objectives—annual sales growth of 3 to 5 percent and income growth of 6 to 7 percent at existing restaurants, plus a five-point improvement (based on customer surveys) in speed of service, friendliness, and food quality.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s05_p06">In setting strategic goals and performance objectives for Notes-4-You, you should keep things simple. Because you know you need to make money to stay in business, you could include a financial goal (and related objectives). Your mission statement promises “high-quality, dependable, competitively priced class notes,” so you could focus on the quality of the class notes that you’ll be taking and distributing. Finally, because your mission is to serve students, one goal could be customer oriented. When all’s said and done, your list of goals and objectives might look like this:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s02_s07_s02_p02">An example of how to handle crisis management involves Wendy’s. After learning that a woman claimed she found a fingertip in a bowl of chili she bought at a Wendy’s restaurant in San Jose, California, the company’s public relations team responded quickly. Within a few days, the company announced that the finger didn’t come from an employee or a supplier. Soon after, the police arrested the woman and charged her with attempted grand larceny for lying about how the finger got in her bowl of chili and trying to extort $2.5 million from the company. But the crisis wasn’t over for Wendy’s. The incident was plastered all over the news as a grossed-out public sought an answer to the question, “Whose finger is (or was) it?” A $100,000 reward was offered by Wendy’s to anyone with information that would help the police answer this question. The challenge Wendy’s faced was how to entice customers to return to its fifty San Francisco–area restaurants (where sales had plummeted) while keeping a low profile nationally. It accomplished this by giving out free milkshakes and discount coupons to customers in the affected regions and, to avoid calling attention to the missing finger, by making no changes in its national advertising. The crisis-management strategy worked and the story died down (though it flared up temporarily when the police arrested the woman’s husband, who allegedly bought the finger from a coworker who had severed it in an accident months earlier).<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111110-141520-611550">Stewart Elliott, “Wendy’s Gets a Break, but Still Has Work Ahead of It,” <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em>, April 29, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/29/business/media/29adco.html?ei=5088&amp;en=bb0e017145269f5e&amp;">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/29/business/media/29adco.html?ei=5088&amp;en=bb0e017145269f5e&amp;</a> (accessed October 8, 2011).</span></p>

For one thing, the culprits in the Wendy’s case were caught, and the public is willing to forgive an organization it views as a victim. Given the current public distrust of corporate behavior, however, companies whose reputations have suffered due to questionable corporate judgment don’t fare as well. These companies include the international oil company, BP, whose CEO, Tony Hayward, did a disastrous job handling the crisis created when a BP controlled oil rig exploded in the Gulf Coast killing eleven workers and creating the largest oil spill in U.S. history. Hayward’s lack of sensitivity will be remembered forever; particularly his response to a reporter’s question on what he would tell those whose livelihoods were ruined: “We’re sorry for the massive disruption it’s caused their lives. There’s no one who wants this over more than I do. I would like my life back.” His comment was obviously upsetting to the families of the eleven men who lost their lives on the rig and had no way to get their lives back.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn06_021">“Embattled BP Chief: I Want My Life Back,” <em class="emphasis">The Times of London</em>, May 31, 2010.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s01_p01">A typical organization has several layers of management. Think of these layers as forming a pyramid like the one in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch06_s03_s01_f01">Figure 6.3 "Levels of Management"</a>, with top managers occupying the narrow space at the peak, first-line managers the broad base, and middle-managers the levels in between. As you move up the pyramid, management positions get more demanding, but they carry more authority and responsibility (along with more power, prestige, and pay). Top managers spend most of their time in planning and decision making, while first-line managers focus on day-to-day operations. For obvious reasons, there are far more people with positions at the base of the pyramid than there are with jobs at the other two levels (as you get to the top, there are only a few positions). Let’s look at each management level in more detail.</p>

The same person would keep track of all sales and copying costs and give any profit—sales minus copying costs minus compensation—to you. The process seems simple, but is it really <em class="emphasis">efficient</em>? Will you earn the maximum amount of profit? Probably not. Even a company as small as Notes-4-You can benefit from specialization. It would function more efficiently if some employees specialized in taking notes, others in copying and packaging them, and still others in selling them. Higher-level employees could focus on advertising, accounting, finance, and human resources.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s02_s01_p04">Obviously, specialization has advantages. In addition to increasing efficiency, for example, it results in jobs that are easier to learn. But it has disadvantages, too. Doing the same thing over and over bores people and will eventually leave employees dissatisfied with their jobs. Before long, you’ll notice decreased performance and increased absenteeism and turnover.</p>

This form of organization is fairly typical for small to medium-size companies, which group their people by business functions: accountants are grouped together, as are people in finance, marketing and sales, human resources, production, and research and development. Each unit is headed by an individual with expertise in the unit’s particular function. The head of an accounting department, for example, will be a senior accountant; the head of a hospital nursing unit will obviously be an experienced nurse. This structure is also appropriate for nonprofits. Think about your school, for instance: mathematics teachers are in the math department, history teachers are in the history department, those who run athletic programs are in the athletic department, and librarians work at the library.</p>

The structure is simple to understand and enables the staff to specialize in particular areas; everyone in the marketing group would probably have similar interests and expertise. But homogeneity also has drawbacks: it can hinder communication and decision making between units and even promote interdepartmental conflict. The marketing department, for example, might butt heads with the accounting department because marketers want to spend as much as possible on advertising, while accountants want to control costs. Marketers might feel that accountants are too tight with funds, and accountants might regard marketers as spendthrifts.</p>

Because you’ve started out small, neither your accounting manager nor your human resources manager will be currently managing anyone directly.

Because four managers report to you, you’ll be connected to four positions; that is, you’ll have four direct “reports.” Your marketing and operations managers will each be connected to two positions and their supervisors to one position each. The organization chart shows that if a member of the sales staff has a problem, he or she will report it to the sales supervisor.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s03_s01_p02">Theoretically, you will communicate only with your four direct reports, but this isn’t the way things normally work.

Some companies might ultimately rely on a combination of functional and divisional structures.

As a rule, new organizations (such as Notes-4-You) have only a few layers of management—an organizational structure that’s often called <em class="emphasis">flat</em>. Let’s say, for instance, that a member of the Notes-4-You sales staff wanted to express concern about slow sales among a certain group of students.

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s03_s02_s02_p02">As a company grows, however, it tends to add more layers between the top and the bottom; that is, it gets <em class="emphasis">taller</em>. Added layers of management can slow down communication and decision making, causing the organization to become less efficient and productive.

If, for example, you remove layers of management to make your organization flatter, you end up increasing the number of positions reporting to a particular supervisor. If you refer back to the organization chart in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch06_s03_s03_f01">Figure 6.5 "Organization Chart for Notes-4-You"</a>, you’ll recall that, under your present structure, four managers report to you as the president of Notes-4-You: the heads of accounting, marketing, operations, and human resources. In turn, two of these managers have positions reporting to them: the advertising manager and sales supervisor report to the marketing manager, while the notetaker’s supervisor and the copier’s supervisor report to the operations manager. Let’s say that you remove a layer of management by getting rid of the marketing and operations managers. Your organization would be flatter, but what would happen to your workload? As president, you’d now have six direct reports rather than four: accounting manager, advertising manager, sales manager, notetaker supervisor, copier supervisor, and human resources manager.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s03_s02_s05_p01">If and when your company expands (say, by offering note-taking services at other schools), you’ll have to decide whether most decisions should still be made by individuals at the top or delegated to lower-level employees. The first option, in which most decision making is concentrated at the top, is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">centralization</a><span class="glossdef">Decision-making process in which most decision making is concentrated at the top.</span></span>.

                <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s03_s03_s02_s05_p02">Let’s say that you favor decentralizing Notes-4-You some four or five years down the road, when the company has expanded. Naturally, there are some decisions—such as strategic planning—that you won’t delegate to lower-level employees, but you could certainly delegate the management of copy-center operations. In fact, putting someone in charge of this function would probably improve customer satisfaction, because copy-center customers would be dealing directly with the manager. It would also give the manager valuable decision-making experience, and while he or she is busy making daily decisions about the copy center, you’ll have more time to work on higher-level tasks. The more you think about the possibility of decentralizing your company, the more you like the idea. First, though, you have to see it through its difficult start-up years.</p>

                        <li>Managers coordinate the activities identified in the planning process among individuals, departments, or other units and allocate the resources needed to perform them.</li>
                        <li>Typically, there are three levels of management: <strong class="emphasis bold">top managers</strong>, who are responsible for overall performance; <strong class="emphasis bold">middle managers</strong>, who report to top managers and oversee lower-level managers; and <strong class="emphasis bold">first-line managers</strong>, who supervise employees to make sure that work is performed correctly and on time.</li>
                        <li>Management must develop an <strong class="emphasis bold">organizational structure</strong>, or arrangement of people within the organization, that will best achieve company goals.</li>
                        <li>The process begins with <strong class="emphasis bold">specialization</strong>—dividing necessary tasks into jobs; the principle of grouping jobs into units is called <strong class="emphasis bold">departmentalization</strong>.</li>

Your career path at Hershey Foods might follow a typical path: When you finish college, you may enter the business world as a first-line manager. After about ten years, you will probably have advanced to the middle-management level. Perhaps you’ll keep moving up and eventually find yourself in a top-level management position with a big salary. Examining job opportunities may be an opportunity to start identifying the kinds of positions that interest you. Go to <a class="link" href="http://www.hersheys.com">http://www.hersheys.com</a> to link to the Hershey Foods Web site, click on “careers” at the bottom of the home page, and check out available positions.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s04_s01_p01">Actually, it’s fairly easy to pick up a baton, cue each section, and strike up the band. But it doesn’t follow that the music will sound good. What if your cues are ignored or misinterpreted or ambiguous? Maybe your musicians don’t like your approach to making music and will just walk away. On top of everything else, you don’t simply want to make music: you want to inspire your musicians to make <em class="emphasis">great</em> music. How do you accomplish this goal? How do you become an effective leader? What style, or approach, should you use to motivate others to achieve organizational goals?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s04_s01_p02">Unfortunately, there are no definitive answers to questions like these. Over time, every manager refines his or her own <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">leadership style</a><span class="glossdef">Particular approach used by a manager to interact with and influence others.</span></span>, or way of interacting with and influencing others. Despite a vast range of personal differences, leadership styles tend to reflect one of the following approaches to directing and motivating people: the <em class="emphasis">autocratic</em>, the <em class="emphasis">democratic</em>, or the <em class="emphasis">laissez-faire</em>. Let’s see how managerial styles reflect each of them in a work situation.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch06_s04_s01_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Autocratic style</em>.

They’re also more likely to keep subordinates informed about things that affect their work.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Laissez-faire style</em>. In practicing a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">laissez-faire leadership style</a><span class="glossdef">Management style used by those who follow a “hands-off” approach and provide relatively little direction to subordinates.</span></span>, managers adopt a “hands-off” approach and provide relatively little direction to subordinates. They may advise employees but usually give them considerable freedom to solve problems and make decisions on their own.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s04_s01_p03">At first glance, you’d probably not want to work for an autocratic leader. After all, you certainly don’t want to be told what to do without having any input. You probably like the idea of working for a democratic leader; it’s flattering to be asked for your input. Though working in a laissez-faire environment might seem a little unsettling at first, the opportunity to make your own decisions is appealing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s04_s01_p04">In general, your assessments of the three leadership styles would be accurate. Employees generally dislike working for autocratic leaders; they like working for democratic leaders, and they find working for laissez-faire leaders rewarding (as long as they feel they can handle the job). But there are situations when these generalities don’t hold.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s04_s01_p05">To learn what these situations are, let’s turn things around and pretend you’re the leader. To make it applicable to your current life, we’ll say that you’re leading a group of fellow students in a team project for your class. Are there times when it would be best for you to use an autocratic leadership style? What if your team was newly formed, unfamiliar with what needs to be done, under a tight deadline, and looking to you for direction? In this situation, you might find it appropriate to follow an autocratic leadership style (on a temporary basis) and assign tasks to each member of the group.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s04_s01_p06">Now let’s look at the leadership style you probably prefer—the democratic leadership style. Can you think of a situation where this style would <em class="emphasis">not</em> work for your team? What if the members of your team are unmotivated, don’t seem interested in providing input, and aren’t getting along? It might make sense to move away from a democratic style of leadership (temporarily) and delegate specific tasks to each member of the group that they can do on their own.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s04_s01_p07">How about laissez-faire leadership? Will this always work with your group? Not always. It will work if your team members are willing and able to work independently and welcome the chance to make decisions. Otherwise, it could cause the team to miss deadlines or do poorly on the project.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s04_s01_p08">The point being made here is that no one leadership style is effective all the time for all people. While the democratic style is viewed as the most appropriate (as is the laissez-faire style, to a lesser extent), there are times when following an autocratic style is better. Good leaders learn how to adjust their styles to fit both the situation and the individuals being directed.</p>
        <div class="section" id="collins-ch06_s04_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Transformational Leadership</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s04_s01_s01_p01">Theories on what constitutes effective leadership evolve over time. One theory that has received a lot of attention in the last decade contrasts two leadership styles: <em class="emphasis">transactional</em> and <em class="emphasis">transformational</em>. So-called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transactional leaders</a><span class="glossdef">Managers who exercise authority based on their rank in the organization and focus their attention on identifying mistakes.</span></span> exercise authority based on their rank in the organization. They let subordinates know what’s expected of them and what they will receive if they meet stated objectives. They focus their attention on identifying mistakes and disciplining employees for poor performance. By contrast, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transformational leaders</a><span class="glossdef">Managers who mentor and develop subordinates and stimulate them to look beyond personal interests to those of the group.</span></span> mentor and develop subordinates, providing them with challenging opportunities, working one-on-one to help them meet their professional and personal needs, and encouraging people to approach problems from new perspectives. They stimulate employees to look beyond personal interests to those of the group.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s04_s01_s01_p02">So, which leadership style is more effective? You probably won’t be surprised by the opinion of most experts. In today’s organizations, in which team building and information sharing are important and projects are often collaborative in nature, transformational leadership has proven to be more effective. Modern organizations look for managers who can develop positive relationships with subordinates and motivate employees to focus on the interests of the organization.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn06_016">See Karen Collins, <em class="emphasis">Accountants’ Management Styles and Effectiveness</em> (American Woman’s Society of Certified Public Accountants, 1997).</span></p>

As founder of Notes-4-You, you began by establishing plans for your new company. You defined its mission and set objectives, or performance targets, which you needed to meet in order to achieve your mission. Then, you organized your company by allocating the people and resources required to carry out your plans. Finally, you provided focus and direction to your employees and motivated them to achieve organizational objectives. Is your job finished? Can you take a well-earned vacation? Unfortunately, the answer is no: your work has just begun. Now that things are rolling along, you need to monitor your operations to see whether everything is going according to plan. If it’s not, you’ll need to take corrective action.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s05_s01_p01">You can think of the control function as the five-step process outlined in <a class="xref" href="#collins-ch06_s05_s01_f01">Figure 6.10 "Five-Step Control Process"</a>.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s05_s01_p02">Let’s see how this process might work at Notes-4-You. Let’s assume that, after evaluating class enrollments, you estimate that you can sell one hundred notes packages per month to students taking the sophomore-level geology course popularly known as “Rocks for Jocks.” So you set your standard at a hundred units. At the end of the month, however, you look over your records and find that you sold only eighty. Comparing your actual performance with your planned performance, you realize that you came up twenty packages short. In talking with your salespeople, you learn why: it turns out that the copy machine broke down so often that packages frequently weren’t ready on time. You immediately take corrective action by increasing maintenance on the copy machine.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s05_s01_p03">Now, let’s try a slightly different scenario. Let’s say that you still have the same standard (one hundred packages) and that actual sales are still eighty packages. In investigating the reason for the shortfall, you find that you overestimated the number of students taking “Rocks for Jocks.” Calculating a more accurate number of students, you see that your original standard—estimated sales—was too high by twenty packages. In this case, you should adjust your standards to reflect expected sales of eighty packages.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch06_s05_s01_p04">In both situations, your control process has been helpful. In the first instance, you were alerted to a problem that cut into your sales. Correcting this problem would undoubtedly increase sales and, therefore, profits. In the second case, you encountered a defect in your planning and learned a good managerial lesson: plan more carefully.</p>

Unless you develop certain <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">time-management skills</a><span class="glossdef">Skills used to manage time effectively.</span></span>, you risk reaching the end of the day feeling that you’ve worked a lot but accomplished little.

To make matters worse, not only are you in trouble academically, but also the other members of your business-project team are annoyed because you’re not pulling your weight. Your lacrosse coach is very upset because you’ve missed too many practices, and members of the mountain-biking club of which you’re supposed to be president are talking about impeaching you if you don’t show up at the next meeting. And your girlfriend says you’re ignoring her. (You can substitute “boyfriend” here, of course; we’re just trying to keep our exposition as simple as possible.)</p>

<em class="emphasis">Identify the problem you want to work on</em>. Step one is getting to know your problem, which you can formulate by asking yourself a basic question: How can I improve my grades?</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Gather relevant data</em>. Step two is gathering information that will shed light on the problem. Let’s rehash some of the relevant information that you’ve already identified: (a) you did poorly on your finals because you didn’t spend enough time studying; (b) you didn’t study because you went to see your girlfriend (who lives about three hours from campus) over the weekend before your exams (and on most other weekends, as a matter of fact); (c) what little studying you got in came at the expense of your team project and lacrosse practice; and (d) while you were away for the weekend, you forgot to tell members of the mountain-biking club that you had to cancel the planned meeting.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Clarify the problem</em>. Once you review all the given facts, you should see that your problem is bigger than simply getting your grades up; your life is pretty much out of control. You can’t handle everything to which you’ve committed yourself. Something has to give. You clarify the problem by summing it up with another basic question: What can I do to get my life back in order?</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Generate possible solutions</em>. If you thought defining the problem was tough, wait until you’ve moved on to this stage. Let’s say that you’ve come up with the following possible solutions to your problem: (a) quit the lacrosse team, (b) step down as president of the mountain-biking club, (c) let team members do your share of work on the business project, and (d) stop visiting your girlfriend so frequently. The solution to your main problem—how to get your life back in order—will probably require multiple actions.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Select the best option</em>. This is clearly the toughest part of the process. Working your way through your various options, you arrive at the following conclusions: (a) you can’t quit the lacrosse team because you’d lose your scholarship; (b) you can resign your post in the mountain-biking club, but that won’t free up much time; (c) you can’t let your business-project team down (and besides, you’d just get a low grade); and (d) she wouldn’t like the idea, but you could visit your girlfriend, say, once a month rather than once a week. So what’s the most feasible (if not necessarily perfect) solution? Probably visiting your girlfriend once a month and giving up the presidency of the mountain-biking club.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Implement your decision and monitor your choice</em>. When you call your girlfriend, you’re pleasantly surprised to find that she understands. The vice president is happy to take over the mountain-biking club. After the first week, you’re able to attend lacrosse practice, get caught up on your team business project, and catch up in all your other classes. The real test of your solution will be the results of the semester’s finals.</li>

And everyone will have to communicate effectively: after all, because you’re in the business of selling written notes, it would look pretty bad if your employees wrote poorly.

Founded as one small doughnut shop in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in 1937, the brand became increasingly popular over the next six decades, taking off in the 1980s and 1990s. By 2003, Krispy Kreme (which went public in 2000) was selling more than a billion doughnuts a year. That’s when things started to go stale.

Unfortunately, other (more plausible) explanations were beginning to surface. To complete this exercise, you’ll need to find out what they were.

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch06_s07_p21">About three years after the company’s founding, the management team decided to expand sales into Asia. The director of sales retained responsibility for the United States, while a new director was added for Asia. The two salespeople who had been with the company since its beginning focused on U.S. sales, and two new salespeople were hired to handle Asia. No other position changed, and for the next two years, all personnel worked out of the U.S. headquarters.</p>

        <p class="para" id="collins-ch06_s07_p22">By the beginning of the fifth year of operations, Asian and U.S. sales were about the same. At this point, management decided to set up two separate operations—one in the United States and the other in China. A senior VP was hired to head each operation—senior VP of U.S. operations and senior VP of Asian operations. Both would report to the CEO. Each operational unit would run its own production facilities, arrange its own financing, and be in charge of its sales and marketing activities. As a result, High-Tech Cases almost doubled in size, but management believed that the restructuring was appropriate and would increase profits in the long run.</p>
