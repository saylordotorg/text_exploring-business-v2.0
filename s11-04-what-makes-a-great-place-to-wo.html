Having compiled its list for more than twenty years, the institute concludes that the defining characteristic of a great company to work for is trust between managers and employees. Employees overwhelmingly say that they want to work at a place where employees “trust the people they work for, have pride in what they do, and enjoy the people they work with.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_026">“What Is a Great Workplace?,” Great Place to Work Institute, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.greatplacetowork.com/our-approach/what-is-a-great-workplace">http://www.greatplacetowork.com/our-approach/what-is-a-great-workplace</a> (accessed October 10, 2011).</span> They report that they’re motivated to perform well because they’re challenged, respected, treated fairly, and appreciated.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s01_p01">The average employee spends more than two thousand hours a year at work.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s01_s01_p01">Specialization promotes efficiency because workers get very good at doing particular tasks.

A computer maker, for example, might rotate a technician into the sales department to increase the employee’s awareness of customer needs and to give the employee a broader understanding of the company’s goals and operations. A hotel might rotate an accounting clerk to the check-in desk for a few hours each day to add variety to the daily workload. Rotated employees develop new skills and gain experience that increases their value to the company, which benefits management because cross-trained employees can fill in for absentees, thus providing greater flexibility in scheduling.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s01_s03_p02">Consider, for example, the evolving role of support staff in the contemporary office. Today, employees who used to be called “secretaries” assume many duties previously in the domain of management, such as project coordination and public relations. Information technology has enriched their jobs because they can now apply such skills as word processing, desktop publishing, creating spreadsheets, and managing databases. That’s why we now hear such a term as <em class="emphasis">administrative assistant</em> instead of <em class="emphasis">secretary</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_028">Sandra Kerka, “The Changing Role of Support Staff,” <a class="link" href="http://calpro-online.com/eric/docgen.asp?tbl=archive&amp;ID=A019">http://calpro-online.com/eric/docgen.asp?tbl=archive&amp;ID=A019</a> (accessed October 10, 2011).</span></p>

You’re connected to the office by computer, fax, and phone. You save on commuting time, enjoy more flexible work hours, and have more opportunity to spend time with your family. A study of 5,500 IBM employees (one-fifth of whom telecommute) found that those who worked at home not only had a better balance between work and home life but also were more highly motivated and less likely to leave the organization.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_032">Reported in Work-Life and Human Capital Solutions, <em class="emphasis">The Business Case for Telecommuting</em> (Minnetonka, MN: WFC Resources), <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://worklifeexpo.com/EXPO/docs/The_Business_Case_for_Telecommuting-WFCResources.pdf">http://worklifeexpo.com/EXPO/docs/The_Business_Case_for_Telecommuting-WFCResources.pdf</a>, (accessed October 10, 2011).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s03_s01_p01">Caring for dependents—young children and elderly parents—is of utmost importance to some employees, but combining dependent-care responsibilities with a busy job can be particularly difficult. KPMG provides on-site child care during tax season (when employees are especially busy) and offers emergency backup dependent care all year round, either at a provider’s facility or in the employee’s home. To get referrals or information, employees can call KPMG’s LifeWorks Resource and Referral Service. KPMG is by no means unique in this respect: more than eight thousand companies maintain on-site day care,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_034">Bonnie Harris, “Child Care Comes to Work,” <em class="emphasis">Los Angeles Times</em>, November 19, 2000, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/19/news/wp-54138">http://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/19/news/wp-54138</a>, (accessed October 11, 2011).</span> and 18 percent of all U.S. companies offer child-care resources or referral services.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_035">“New List of Best Companies for Mom,” <em class="emphasis">CNNMoney</em>, September 23, 2003 <a class="link" href="http://money.cnn.com/2003/09/23/news/companies/working_mother/?cnn=yes">http://money.cnn.com/2003/09/23/news/companies/working_mother/?cnn=yes</a> (accessed October 11, 2011).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Unmarried without Children</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s04_p01">You’ve undoubtedly noticed by now that many programs for balancing work and personal lives target married people, particularly those with children. Single individuals also have trouble striking a satisfactory balance between work and nonwork activities, but many single workers feel that they aren’t getting equal consideration from employers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_036">See Karen Collins and Elizabeth Hoover, “Addressing the Needs of the Single Person in Public Accounting,” <em class="emphasis">Pennsylvania CPA Journal</em>, June 1995, 16.</span> They report that they’re often expected to work longer hours, travel more, and take on difficult assignments to compensate for married employees with family commitments.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s04_p02">Needless to say, requiring singles to take on additional responsibilities can make it harder for them to balance their work and personal lives. It’s harder to plan and keep personal commitments while meeting heavy work responsibilities, and establishing and maintaining social relations is difficult if work schedules are unpredictable or too demanding. Frustration can lead to increased stress and job dissatisfaction. In several studies of stress in the accounting profession, unmarried workers reported higher levels of stress than any other group, including married people with children.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_037">Data was obtained from 1988 and 1991 studies of stress in public accounting by Karen Collins and from a 1995 study on quality of life in the accounting profession by Collins and Jeffrey Greenhaus. Analysis of the data on single individuals was not separately published.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s04_p03">With singles, as with married people, companies can reap substantial benefits from programs that help employees balance their work and nonwork lives: they can increase job satisfaction and employee productivity and reduce turnover. PepsiCo, for example, offers a “concierge service,” which maintains a dry cleaner, travel agency, convenience store, and fitness center on the premises of its national office in Somers, New York.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_070">“Concierge Service Is A Surprisingly Low Cost Solution That Can Meet A Variety Of Needs With A Single Provider,” Lifestyle Concierge Services, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.lifestyleconciergeservices.com/Corporate-Concierge-Service-for-businesses.html">http://www.lifestyleconciergeservices.com/Corporate-Concierge-Service-for-businesses.html</a> (accessed October 11, 2011).</span> Single employees seem to find these services helpful, but what they value most of all is control over their time. In particular, they want predictable schedules that allow them to plan social and personal activities. They don’t want employers assuming that being single means that they can change plans at the last minute. It’s often more difficult for singles to deal with last-minute changes because, unlike married coworkers, they don’t have the at-home support structure to handle such tasks as tending to elderly parents or caring for pets.</p>

    <div class="section" id="collins-ch07_s04_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Compensation and Benefits</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s05_p01">Though paychecks and benefits packages aren’t the only reasons why people work, they do matter. Competitive pay and benefits also help organizations attract and retain qualified employees. Companies that pay their employees more than their competitors generally have lower turnover. Consider, for example, The Container Store, which regularly appears on <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> magazine’s list of “The 100 Best Companies to Work For.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_038">“The 100 Best Companies to Work For,” <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/bestcompanies/2011/index.html">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/bestcompanies/2011/index.html</a> (accessed October 10, 2011).</span> The retail chain staffs its stores with fewer employees than its competitors but pays them more—in some cases, three times the industry average for retail workers. This strategy allows the company to attract extremely talented workers who, moreover, aren’t likely to leave the company. Low turnover is particularly valuable in the retail industry because it depends on service-oriented personnel to generate repeat business.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s05_p02">In addition to salary and wages, compensation packages often include other financial incentives, such as bonuses and profit-sharing plans, as well as benefits, such as medical insurance, vacation time, sick leave, and retirement accounts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="collins-ch07_s04_s06">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Wages and Salaries</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s06_p01">The largest, and most important, component of a compensation package is the payment of wages or salary. If you’re paid according to the number of hours you work, you’re earning <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wages</a><span class="glossdef">Compensation paid to employees based on the number of hours worked.</span></span>. Counter personnel at McDonald’s, for instance, get wages, which are determined by multiplying an employee’s hourly wage rate by the number of hours worked during the pay period. On the other hand, if you’re paid for fulfilling the responsibilities of a position—regardless of the number of hours required to do it—you’re earning a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">salary</a><span class="glossdef">Compensation paid for fulfilling the responsibilities of a position regardless of the number of hours required to do it.</span></span>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s07_p01">In addition to regular paychecks, many people receive financial rewards based on performance, whether their own, their employer’s, or both.

All three plans are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">incentive programs</a><span class="glossdef">Program designed to financially reward employees for good performance.</span></span>: programs designed to reward employees for good performance.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_041">Texas Instruments, “Benefits,” <a class="link" href="http://www.ti.com/recruit/docs/benefits.shtml">http://www.ti.com/recruit/docs/benefits.shtml</a> (accessed October 11, 2011).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s07_s01_p02">Bonus plans have become quite common, and the range of employees eligible for bonuses has widened in recent years. In the past, bonus plans were usually reserved for managers above a certain level. Today, however, companies have realized the value of extending plans to include employees at virtually every level. The magnitude of bonuses still favors those at the top. High-ranking officers (such as CEOs and CFOs) often get bonuses ranging from 30 percent to 50 percent of their salaries. Upper-level managers may get from 15 percent to 25 percent and middle managers from 10 percent to 15 percent. At lower levels, employees may expect bonuses from 3 percent to 5 percent of their annual compensation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_042">Jeff D.

            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s07_s02_p01">TI also maintains a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">profit-sharing plan</a><span class="glossdef">Incentive program that uses a predetermined formula to distribute a share of company profits to eligible employees.</span></span>, which relies on a predetermined formula to distribute a share of the company’s profits to eligible employees. Today, about 40 percent of all U.S. companies offer some type of profit-sharing program.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-collins-fn07_043">Lee Ann Obringer, “How Employee Compensation Works—Stock Options/Profit Sharing,” <em class="emphasis">HowStuffWorks</em>, <a class="link" href="http://money.howstuffworks.com/benefits.htm">http://money.howstuffworks.com/benefits.htm</a> (accessed October 11, 2011).</span> TI’s plan, however, is a little unusual: while most plans don’t allow employees to access profit-sharing funds until retirement or termination, TI employees get their shares immediately—in cash.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s07_s02_p02">TI’s plan is also pretty generous—as long as the company has a good year. Here’s how it works. An employee’s profit share depends on the company’s operating profit for the year. If profits from operations reach 10 percent of sales, the employee gets a bonus worth 4 percent of his or her salary. If operating profit soars to 20 percent, the employee bonuses go up to 26 percent of salary. But if operating profits fall short of a certain threshold, nobody gets anything.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111110-153222-408935">Texas Instruments, “Benefits,” <a class="link" href="http://www.ti.com/recruit/docs/profit.shtml">http://www.ti.com/recruit/docs/profit.shtml</a> (accessed October 11, 2011).</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Stock-Option Plans</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s07_s03_p01">Like most <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stock-option plans</a><span class="glossdef">Incentive program that allows eligible employees to buy a specific number of shares of company stock at a set price on a specified date.</span></span>, the TI plan gives employees the right to buy a specific number of shares of company stock at a set price on a specified date. At TI, an employee may buy stock at its selling price at the time when he or she was given the option. So, if the price of the stock goes up, the employee benefits. Say, for example, that the stock was selling for $30 a share when the option was granted in 2007. In 2011, it was selling for $40 a share. Exercising his or her option, the employee could buy TI stock at the 2007 price of $30 a share—a bargain price.<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111110-153310-774836">Texas Instruments, “Benefits,” <a class="link" href="http://www.ti.com/recruit/docs/profit.shtml">http://www.ti.com/recruit/docs/profit.shtml</a> (accessed October 11, 2011).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s07_s03_p02">At TI, stock options are used as an incentive to attract and retain top people. Starbucks, by contrast, isn’t nearly as selective in awarding stock options. At Starbucks, all employees can earn “Bean Stock”—the Starbucks employee stock-option plan. Both full- and part-time employees get options to buy Starbucks shares at a set price. If the company does well and its stock goes up, employees make a profit. CEO Howard Schultz believes that Bean Stock pays off: because employees are rewarded when the company does well, they have a stronger incentive to add value to the company (and so drive up its stock price). Shortly after the program was begun, the phrase “bean-stocking” became workplace lingo for figuring out how to save the company money.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Benefits</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s08_p01">Another major component of an employee’s compensation package is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">benefits</a><span class="glossdef">Compensation other than salaries, hourly wages, or financial incentives.</span></span>—compensation other than salaries, hourly wages, or financial incentives. Types of benefits include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s08_l01">
            <li>Legally required benefits (Social Security and Medicare, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation)</li>
            <li>Paid time off (vacations, holidays, sick leave)</li>
            <li>Insurance (health benefits, life insurance, disability insurance)</li>
            <li>Retirement benefits</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s08_p02">Unfortunately, the cost of providing benefits is staggering. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, it costs an employer 30 percent of a worker’s salary to provide the same worker with benefits. If you include pay for time not worked (while on vacation or sick and so on), the percentage increases to 41 percent. So if you’re a manager making $100,000 a year, your employer is also paying out another $41,000 for your benefits. The most money goes for health care (8 percent of salary costs), paid time off (11 percent), and retirement benefits (5 percent).<span class="footnote" id="collins-5300-20111110-153411-938820">“FAQs About Benefits—General Overview,” Employee Benefit Research Institute, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ebri.org/publications/benfaq/?fa=fullfaq">http://www.ebri.org/publications/benfaq/?fa=fullfaq</a> (accessed October 10, 2011).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="collins-ch07_s04_s08_p03">Some workers receive only benefits required by law, including Social Security, unemployment, and workers’ compensation.
